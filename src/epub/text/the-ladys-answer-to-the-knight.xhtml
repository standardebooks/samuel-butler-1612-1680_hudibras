			<p>
				<span>That you’re a beast, and turn’d to grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is no strange news, nor ever was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At least to me, who once, you know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did from the pound replevin you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When both your sword and spurs were won</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In combat by an Amazon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sword, that did (like Fate) determine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ inevitable death of vermin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never dealt its furious blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But cut the throats of pigs and cows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Trulla was, in single fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disarm’d and wrested from its Knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your heels degraded of your spurs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the stocks close prisoners;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where still they’d lain, in base restraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I, in pity of your complaint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not, on honourable conditions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Releas’d ’em from the worst of prisons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what return that favour met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You cannot (though you would) forget;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, being free, you strove t’ evade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The oaths you had in prison made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forswore yourself, and first deny’d it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But after own’d and justify’d it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when y’ had falsely broke one vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Absolv’d yourself by breaking two:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For while you sneakingly submit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beg for pardon at our feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Discourag’d by your guilty fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hope for quarter for your ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doubting ’twas in vain to sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You claim us boldly as your due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Declare that treachery and force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To deal with us, is th’ only course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have no title nor pretence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To body, soul, or conscience;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ought to fall to that man’s share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That claims us for his proper ware.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These are the motives which, t’ induce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fright us into love, you use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pretty new way of gallanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between soliciting and ranting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sturdy beggars, that entreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For charity at once, and threat!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since you undertake to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own propriety in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if we were but lawful prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In war between two enemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or forfeitures, which ev’ry lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That would but sue for, might recover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not hard to understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The myst’ry of this bold demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cannot at our persons aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But something capable of claim.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis not those paltry counterfeit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>French stones, which in our eyes you set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But our right diamonds, that inspire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set your am’rous hearts on fire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor can those false <abbr>St.</abbr> Martin’s beads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which on our lips you lay for reds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make us wear, like Indian dames,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Add fuel to your scorching flames,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But those true rubies of the rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which in our cabinets we lock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis not those orient pearls, our teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you are so transported with;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But those we wear about our necks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Produce those amorous effects.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor is ’t those threads of gold, our hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The periwigs you make us wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But those bright guineas in our chests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That light the wild-fire in your breasts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These love-tricks I’ve been vers’d in so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all their sly intrigues I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And can unriddle, by their tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their mystic cabals and jargons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can tell what passions, by their sounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pine for the beauties of my grounds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What raptures fond and amorous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ charms and graces of my house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What ecstasy and scorching flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burns for my money in my name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What from th’ unnatural desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To beasts and cattle takes its fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What tender sigh, and trickling tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Longs for a thousand pounds a year;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And languishing transports are fond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of statute, mortgage, bill, and bond.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These are th’ attracts which most men fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enamour’d, at first sight, withal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these th’ address with serenades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And court with balls and masquerades;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, for all the yearning pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y’ have suffer’d for their loves in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fear they’ll prove so nice and coy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have, and t’ hold, and to enjoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all your oaths and labour lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ll ne’er turn ladies of the post.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is not meant to disapprove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your judgment in your choice of love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is so wise the greatest part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of mankind study ’t as an art;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love should, like a deodand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still fall to th’ owner of the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where there’s substance for its ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot but be more firm and sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that which has the slightest basis</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of airy virtue, wit, and graces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is of such thin subtlety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It steals and creeps in at the eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as it can’t endure to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steals out again as nice a way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But love, that its extraction owns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From solid gold and precious stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must, like its shining parents, prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As solid, and as glorious love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence ’tis you have no way t’ express</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our charms and graces but by these:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what are lips, and eyes, and teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which beauty invades and conquers with,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rubies, pearls, and diamonds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which a philtre love commands?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This is the way all parents prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In managing their children’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That force ’em t’ intermarry and wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if th’ were burying of the dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast earth to earth, as in the grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To join in wedlock all they have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when the settlement’s in force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take all the rest for better or worse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For money has a power above</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars and fate to manage love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose arrows, learned poets hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never miss, are tipp’d with gold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-218" id="noteref-218" epub:type="noteref">218</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though some say the parents’ claims</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make love in their children’s names,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who many times at once provide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nurse, the husband, and the bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feel darts and charms, attracts and flames,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And woo and contract in their names,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as they christen, use to marry ’em,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like their gossips, answer for ’em;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not to give in matrimony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sell and prostitute for money;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis better than their own betrothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who often do ’t for worse than nothing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when th’ are at their own dispose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With greater disadvantage choose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All this is right; but for the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You take to do ’t, by fraud or force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis so ridiculous, as soon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As told, ’tis never to be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more than setters can betray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That tell what tricks they are to play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marriage, at best, is but a vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which all men either break or bow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then what will those forbear to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who perjure when they do but woo?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as before-hand swear and lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For earnest to their treachery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, rather than a crime confess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With greater strive to make it less?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like thieves, who, after sentence past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maintain their innocence to the last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when their crimes were made appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As plain as witnesses can swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, when the wretches come to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will take upon their death a lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor are the virtues you confess’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ your ghostly father, as you guess’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So slight as to be justify’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By being as shamefully deny’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if you thought your word would pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point-blank, on both sides of a case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or credit were not to be lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>B’ a brave Knight-Errant of the Post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eats perfidiously his word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swears his ears through a two-inch board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can own the same thing, and disown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And perjure booty, pro and con;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can make the Gospel serve his turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And help him out, to be forsworn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When ’tis laid hands upon, and kist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be betray’d and sold, like Christ.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These are the virtues in whose name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A right to all the world you claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And boldly challenge a dominion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In grace and nature, o’er all women;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom no less will satisfy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the sex your tyranny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although you’ll find it a hard province,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all your crafty frauds and covins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To govern such a num’rous crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, one by one, now govern you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if you all were Solomons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wise and great as he was once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll find they’re able to subdue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As they did him) and baffle you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And if you are impos’d upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis by your own temptation done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with your ignorance invite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And teach us how to use the slight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when we find y’ are still more taken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With false attracts of our own making,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear that’s a rose, and that a stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sots, to us that laid it on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what we did but slightly prime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most ignorantly daub in rhyme;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You force us, in our own defences,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To copy beams and influences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lay perfections on the graces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And draw attracts upon our faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in compliance to your wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own false jewels counterfeit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by the practice of those arts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We gain a greater share of hearts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those deserve in reason most</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That greatest pains and study cost:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For great perfections are, like heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too rich a present to be given.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor are these master-strokes of beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be perform’d without hard duty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, when they’re nobly done and well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The simple natural excel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fair and sweet the planted rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the wild in hedges grows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For without art the noblest seeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of flow’rs degen’rate into weeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How dull and rugged, ere ’tis ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And polish’d looks a diamond!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though Paradise were e’er so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was not kept so without care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole world, without art and dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would be but one great wilderness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mankind but a savage herd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all that nature has conferr’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This does but rough-hew, and design;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaves art to polish and refine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though women first were made for men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet men were made for them agen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when (outwitted by his wife)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man first turn’d tenant but for life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If women had not interven’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How soon had mankind had an end!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that it is in being yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To us alone you are in debt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where’s your liberty of choice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our unnatural no voice?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since all the privilege you boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And falsely usurp’d, or vainly lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is now our right; to whose creation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You owe your happy restoration;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if we had not weighty cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To not appear, in making laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We could, in spite of all your tricks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shallow, formal politics,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Force you our managements t’ obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we to yours (in show) give way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence ’tis that, while you vainly strive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ advance your high prerogative,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You basely, after all your braves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Submit, and own yourselves our slaves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’cause we do not make it known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor publicly our int’rest own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sots, suppose we have no shares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In ord’ring you and your affairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all your empire and command</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You have from us at second hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if a pilot, that appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sit still only while he steers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And does not make a noise and stir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like ev’ry common mariner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew nothing of the card, nor star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did not guide the man-of-war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor we, because we don’t appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In councils, do not govern there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, like the mighty Prester John,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-219" id="noteref-219" epub:type="noteref">219</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose person none dares look upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is preserv’d in close disguise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From being made cheap to vulgar eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ enjoy as large a pow’r unseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To govern him, as he does men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the right of our Pope Joan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make Emp’rors at our feet fall down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Joan de Pucel’s braver name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-220" id="noteref-220" epub:type="noteref">220</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our right to arms and conduct claim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, though a Spinster, yet was able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve France for a Grand Constable.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We make and execute all laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can judge the judges and the cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prescribe all rules of right or wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To th’ long robe, and the longer tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst which the world has no defence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But our more pow’rful eloquence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We manage things of greatest weight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the world’s affairs of state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are ministers of war and peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sway all nations how we please.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We rule all churches and their flocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heretical and orthodox;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are the heavenly vehicles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ spirits in all conventicles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By us is all commerce and trade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Improv’d, and manag’d, and decay’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For nothing can go off so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor bears that price, as what we sell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We rule in ev’ry public meeting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make men do what we judge fitting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are magistrates in all great towns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where men do nothing but wear gowns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We make the man-of-war strike sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to our braver conduct veil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when h’ has chas’d his enemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Submit to us upon his knees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there an officer of state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untimely rais’d, or magistrate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s haughty and imperious?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’s but a journeyman to us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That as he gives us cause to do ’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can keep him in, or turn him out.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We are your guardians, that increase</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or waste your fortunes how we please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as you humour us, can deal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all your matters, ill or well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis we that can dispose, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether your heirs shall be your own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whose integrity you must,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In spite of all your caution, trust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, ’less you fly beyond the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can fit you with what heirs we please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And force you t’ own ’em, though begotten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By French valets, or Irish footmen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor can the rigoroursest course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prevail, unless to make us worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who still, the harsher we are us’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are further off from b’ing reduc’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scorn t’ abate, for any ills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The least punctilios of our wills.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Force does but whet our wits t’ apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arts, born with us for remedy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which all your politics, as yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have ne’er been able to defeat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when y’ have try’d all sorts of ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What fools d’ we make of you in plays!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all the favours we afford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but to girt you with the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fight our battles in our steads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have your brains beat out o’ your heads;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Encounter, in despite of nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fight at once with fire and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pirates, rocks, and storms, and seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our pride and vanity t’ appease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kill one another, and cut throats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For our good graces, and best thoughts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do your exercise for honour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have your brains beat out the sooner;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or crack’d, as learnedly, upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Things that are never to be known;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still appear the more industrious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more your projects are prepost’rous;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To square the circle of the arts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And run stark mad to shew your parts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expound the oracle of laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn them which way we see cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be our solicitors and agents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stand for us in all engagements.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And these are all the mighty pow’rs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You vainly boast to cry down ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what in real value’s wanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Supply with vapouring and ranting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because yourselves are terrify’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stoop to one another’s pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believe we have as little wit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be out-hector’d, and submit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By your example, lose that right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In treaties which we gain’d in fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, terrify’d into an awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass on ourselves a Salique law:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-221" id="noteref-221" epub:type="noteref">221</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, as some nations use, give place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truckle to your mighty race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let men usurp th’ unjust dominion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they were the better women.</span>
