						<span>The Knight and Squire, in hot dispute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within an ace of falling out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are parted with a sudden fright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of strange alarm, and stranger sight;</span>

						<span>With which adventuring to stickle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’re sent away in nasty pickle.</span>

			<p>
				<span>’Tis strange how some men’s tempers suit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Like bawd and brandy) with dispute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for their own opinions stand last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to have them claw’d and canvast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That keep their consciences in cases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fiddlers do their crowds and bases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne’er to be us’d, but when they’re bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To play a fit for argument;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make true and false, unjust and just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of no use but to be discust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispute, and set a paradox</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a straight boot upon the stocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stretch it more unmercifully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Helmont, Montaign, White, or Tully.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So th’ ancient Stoics, in their porch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-98" id="noteref-98" epub:type="noteref">98</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fierce dispute maintain’d their church;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat out their brains in fight and study,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prove that virtue is a body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bonum is an animal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-99" id="noteref-99" epub:type="noteref">99</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made good with stout polemic brawl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which some hundreds on the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were slain outright; and many a face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retrench’d of nose, and eyes, and beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To maintain what their sect averr’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All which the Knight and Squire, in wrath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had like t’ have suffered for their faith;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each striving to make good his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As by the sequel shall be shown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Sun had long since, in the lap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Thetis, taken out his nap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like a lobster boil’d, the morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From black to red began to turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Hudibras, whom thoughts and aking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twixt sleeping kept all night and waking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to rub his drowsy eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from his couch prepar’d to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resolving to dispatch the deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He vow’d to do with trusty speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first, with knocking loud, and bawling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rous’d the Squire, in truckle lolling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after many circumstances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which vulgar authors, in romances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do use to spend their time and wits on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make impertinent description,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They got (with much ado) to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the castle bent their course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which he to the dame before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To suffer whipping duly swore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where now arriv’d, and half unharnest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To carry on the work in earnest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stopp’d, and paus’d upon the sudden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a serious forehead plodding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprung a new scruple his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which first he scratch’d, and after said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether it be direct infringing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An oath, if I should wave this swingeing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what I’ve sworn to bear, forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so b’ equivocation swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether it be a lesser sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be forsworn than act the thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are deep and subtle points, which must,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ inform my conscience, be discust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which to err a little may</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To errors infinite make way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore I desire to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy judgment e’er we further go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralpho, Since you do enjoin’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall enlarge upon the point;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for my own part, do not doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ affirmative may be made out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first, to state the case aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For best advantage of our light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus ’tis: Whether ’t be a sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To claw and curry your own skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greater or less, than to forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that you are forsworn, forswear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first, o’ th’ first: The inward man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And outward, like a clan and clan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have always been at daggers-drawing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one another clapper-clawing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not that they really cuff, or fence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in a spiritual mystic sense;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which to mistake, and make ’em squabble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In literal fray ’s abominable.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis heathenish, in frequent use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Pagans and apostate Jews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To offer sacrifice of bridewells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like modern Indians to their idols;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mongrel Christians of our times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That expiate less with greater crimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And call the foul abomination</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contrition and mortification.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ’t not enough we’re bruis’d and kicked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sinful members of the wicked;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our vessels, that are sanctify’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prophan’d and curry’d back and side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we must claw ourselves with shameful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heathen stripes, by their example;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which (were there nothing to forbid it)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is impious, because they did it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This, therefore, may be justly reckon’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A heinous sin. Now to the second</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saints may claim a dispensation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swear and forswear, on occasion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I doubt not but it will appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pregnant light: the point is clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oaths are but words, and words but wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too feeble implements to bind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hold with deeds proportion so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As shadows to a substance do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then when they strive for place, ’tis fit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weaker vessel should submit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although your church be opposite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ours as Black Friars are to White,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rule and order, yet I grant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You are a Reformado Saint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what the saints do claim as due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You may pretend a title to:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But saints whom oaths and vows oblige,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know little of their privilege;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farther (I mean) than carrying on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some self-advantage of their own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if the dev’l, to serve his turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can tell troth, why the Saints should scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When it serves theirs, to swear and lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think there’s little reason why:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else h’ has a greater power than they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which ’twere impiety to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ are not commanded to forbear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indefinitely at all to swear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to swear idly, and in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without self-interest or gain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For breaking of an oath, and lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but a kind of self-denying;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A saint-like virtue: and from hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some have broke oaths by Providence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some, to the glory of the Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perjur’d themselves, and broke their word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this the constant rule and practice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all our late Apostles’ acts is.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not the cause at first begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With perjury, and carried on?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was there an oath the godly took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in due time and place they broke?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did we not bring our oaths in first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before our plate, to have them burst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast in fitter models for</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The present use of church and war?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not our worthies of the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before they broke the peace, break vows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For having freed us first from both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ allegiance and suprem’cy oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they not next compel the nation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take and break the protestation?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swear, and after to recant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The solemn league and covenant?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take th’ engagement, and disclaim it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enforc’d by those who first did frame it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they not swear, at first, to fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the king’s safety and his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after march’d to find him out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And charg’d him home with horse and foot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yet still had the confidence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swear it was in his defence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they not swear to live and die</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Essex, and straight laid him by?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If that were all, for some have swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As false as they, if th’ did no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they not swear to maintain law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which that swearing made a flaw?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Protestant religion vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That did that vowing disallow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For privilege of Parliament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which that swearing made a rent?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since, of all the three, not one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is left in being, ’tis well known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they not swear, in express words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prop and back the House of Lords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after turn’d out the whole house-full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of peers, as dang’rous and unusefull?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Cromwell, with deep oaths and vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swore all the Commons out o’ th’ House;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vow’d that the red-coats would disband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, marry would they, at their command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And troll’d them on, and swore, and swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till th’ army turn’d them out of door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This tells us plainly what they thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That oaths and swearing go for nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that by them th’ were only meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve for an expedient.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What was the public faith found out for,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to slur men of what they fought for?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The public faith, which ev’ry one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is bound t’ observe, yet kept by none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if that go for nothing, why</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should private faith have such a tie?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oaths were not purpos’d, more than law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the good and just in awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to confine the bad and sinful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like moral cattle, in a pinfold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A saint’s of th’ heav’nly realm a peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as no peer is bound to swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on the gospel of his honour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which he may dispose as owner</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It follows, though the thing be forgery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And false t’ affirm it is no perjury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But a mere ceremony, and a breach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nothing, but a form of speech;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And goes for no more when ’tis took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than mere saluting of the book.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suppose the Scriptures are of force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re but commissions of course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saints have freedom to digress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vary from ’em, as they please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or misinterpret them, by private</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instructions, to all aims they drive at.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then why should we ourselves abridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And curtail our own privilege?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quakers (that, like to lanterns, bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their light within ’em) will not swear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their gospel is an accidence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By which they construe conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hold no sin so deeply red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As that of breaking Priscian’s head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The head and founder of their order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stirring hats held worse than murder);</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These thinking th’ are obliged to troth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In swearing, will not take an oath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like mules, who, if th’ have not their will</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep their own pace, stand stock-still:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they are weak, and little know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What free-born consciences may do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis the temptation of the devil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes all human actions evil:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For saints may do the same things by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Spirit, in sincerity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which other men are tempted to,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the devil’s instance do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet the actions be contrary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as the saints and wicked vary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as on land there is no beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in some fish at sea’s exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So in the wicked there’s no vice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which the saints have not a spice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet that thing that’s pious in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one, in th’ other is a sin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is’t not ridiculous, and nonsense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A saint should be a slave to conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ought to be above such fancies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As far as above ordinances?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She’s of the wicked, as I guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>B’ her looks, her language, and her dress:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though, like constables, we search,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For false wares, one another’s church,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet all of us hold this for true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No faith is to the wicked due:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truth is precious and divine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too rich a pearl for carnal swine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Hudibras, All this is true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet ’tis not fit that all men knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those mysteries and revelations;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore topical evasions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of subtle turns and shifts of sense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Serve best with th’ wicked for pretence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as the learned Jesuits use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Presbyterians, for excuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the Protestants, when th’ happen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find their churches taken napping:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thus: A breach of oath is duple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And either way admits a scruple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may be ex parte of the maker</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More criminal than the injur’d taker;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he that strains too far a vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will break it, like an o’er-bent bow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he that made, and forc’d it, broke it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not he that for convenience took it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A broken oath is, quatenus oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As sound t’ all purposes of troth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As broken laws are ne’er the worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, till th’ are broken have no force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What’s justice to a man, or laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never comes within their claws?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have no pow’r, but to admonishl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot control, coerce, or punish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they’re broken, and then touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those only that do make ’em such.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside, no engagement is allow’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By men in prison made for good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when they’re set at liberty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re from th’ engagement too set free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rabbins write, when any Jew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did make to God or man, a vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which afterward he found untoward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stubborn to be kept, or too hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Any three other Jews o’ th’ nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might free him from the obligation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have not two saints pow’r to use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A greater privilege than three Jews?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The court of conscience, which in man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should be supreme and sovereign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is’t fit should be subordinate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ev’ry petty court i’ the state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have less power than the lesser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To deal with perjury at pleasure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have its proceedings disallow’d, or</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allow’d, at fancy of Pye-Powder?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell all it does, or does not know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For swearing ex officio?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be forc’d t’ impeach a broken hedge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pigs unring’d at <abbr>Vis.</abbr> <abbr>Franc.</abbr> Pledge?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Discover thieves, and bawds, recusants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Priests, witches, eves-droppers, and nuisance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell who did play at games unlawful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who fill’d pots of ale but half full;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have no pow’r at all, nor shift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help itself at a dead lift?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should not conscience have vacation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as other courts o’ th’ nation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have equal power to adjourn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appoint appearance and return;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make as nice distinction serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To split a case, as those that carve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Invoking cuckolds’ names, hit joints?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should not tricks as slight do points?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not th’ High-Court of Justice sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To judge that law that serves their turn?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make their own jealousies high treason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fix ’em whomsoe’er they please on?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot the learned counsel there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make laws in any shape appear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mould ’em as witches do their clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they make pictures to destroy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vex ’em into any form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fits their purpose to do harm?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rack ’em until they do confess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impeach of treason whom they please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And most perfidiously condemn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that engag’d their lives for them?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet do nothing in their own sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But what they ought by oath and conscience.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can they not juggle, and with slight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conveyance, play with wrong and right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sell their blasts of wind as dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Lapland witches bottled air?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not fear, favour, bribe, and grudge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The same case several ways adjudge?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As seamen with the self-same gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will sev’ral diff’rent courses sail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when the sea breaks o’er its bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overflows the level grounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those banks and dams, that, like a screen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did keep it out, now keep it in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when tyrannic usurpation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Invades the freedom of a nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The laws o’ th’ land, that were intended</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep it out, are made defend it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not in Chanc’ry ev’ry man swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What makes best for him in his answer?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not the winding up witnesses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nicking more than half the bus’ness?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For witnesses, like watches, go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as they’re set, too fast or slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where in conscience they’re strait-lac’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis ten to one that side is cast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not your juries give their verdict</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they felt the cause, not heard it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as they please, make matter o’ fact</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Run all on one side, as they’re packt?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature has made man’s breast no windores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To publish what he does within doors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor what dark secrets there inhabit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless his own rash fury blab it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If oaths can do a man no good</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his own bus’ness, why they should</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In other matters do him hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think there’s little reason for’t.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that imposes an oath makes it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not he that for convenience takes it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then how can any man be said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break an oath he never made?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These reasons may, perhaps, look oddly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To th’ wicked, though th’ evince the godly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if they will not serve to clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My honour, I am ne’er the near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honour is like that glassy bubble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That finds philosophers such trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose least part crack’d, the whole does fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wits are crack’d to find out why.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralpho, Honour’s but a word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swear by only in a lord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In other men, ’tis but a huff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To vapour with, instead of proof;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, like a wen, looks big and swells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is senseless, and just nothing else.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let it (quoth he) be what it will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It has the world’s opinion still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as men are not wise that run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slightest hazard they may shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There may a medium be found out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To clear to all the world the doubt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that is, if a man may do’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By proxy whipt, or substitute.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though nice and dark the point appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Quoth Ralph,) it may hold up and clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sinners may supply the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suff’ring saints is a plain case.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Justice gives sentence many times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one man for another’s crimes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our brethren of New England use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Choice malefactors to excuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hang the guiltless in their stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom the churches have less need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As lately ’t happen’d: In a town<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-100" id="noteref-100" epub:type="noteref">100</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>There liv’d a cobbler, and but one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That out of doctrine could cut use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mend men’s lives as well as shoes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This precious brother having slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In time of peace, an Indian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Not out of malice, but mere zeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because he was an Infidel,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty Tottipottymoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent to our elders an envoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Complaining sorely of the breach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of league held forth by brother Patch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the articles in force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between both churches, his and ours;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which he crav’d the saints to render</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into his hands or hang th’ offender:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they maturely having weigh’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had no more but him o’ th’ trade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(A man that serv’d them in a double</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Capacity, to teach and cobble),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resolv’d to spare him; yet, to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Indian Hoghgan Moghgan too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impartial justice, in his stead did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang an old weaver, that was bed-rid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then wherefore may not you be skipp’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in your room another whipp’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all philos’phers, but the sceptic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold whipping may be sympathetic.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is enough, quoth Hudibras,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast resolv’d and clear’d the case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And canst, in conscience, not refuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy own doctrine to raise use.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know thou wilt not (for my sake)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be tender conscienc’d of thy back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then strip thee off thy carnal jerkin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And give thy outward-fellow a ferking;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when thy vessel is new hoop’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All leaks of sinning will be stopp’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralpho, You mistake the matter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in all scruples of this nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No man includes himself, nor turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The point upon his own concerns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As no man of his own self catches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The itch, or amorous French aches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So no man does himself convince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By his own doctrine, of his sins:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though all cry down self, none means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own self in a literal sense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside, it is not only foppish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But vile, idolatrous and popish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one man, out of his own skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ferk and whip another’s sin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pedants out of school-boys’ breeches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do claw and curry their own itches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in this case it is profane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sinful too, because in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we must take our oaths upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You did the deed, when I have done it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Hudibras, That’s answer’d soon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give us the whip, we’ll lay it on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralpho, That we may swear true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twere properer that I whipp’d you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when with your consent ’tis done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The act is really your own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Hudibras, It is in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(I see) to argue ’gainst the grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, like the stars, incline men to</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What they’re averse themselves to do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when disputes are weary’d out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis interest still resolves the doubt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since no reason can confute ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll try to force you to your duty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so it is, howe’er you mince it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, ere we part, I shall evince it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And curry (if you stand out) whether</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You will or no, your stubborn leather.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst thou refuse to hear thy part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ th’ public work, base as thou art?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To higgle thus for a few blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gain thy knight an op’lent spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose wealth his bowels yearn to purchase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merely for th’ interest of the churches?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he has it in his claws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not be hide-bound to the cause:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shalt thou find him a curmudgeon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou dispatch it without grudging:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If not, resolve, before we go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you and I must pull a crow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Y’ had best (quoth Ralpho) as the ancients</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say wisely, have a care o’ th’ main chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look before you ere you leap;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as you sow, y’ are like to reap:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were y’ as good as George-a-Green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall make bold to turn agen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor am I doubtful of the issue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a just quarrel, and mine is so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ’t fitting for a man of honour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whip the saints, like Bishop Bonner?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Knight t’ usurp the beadle’s office,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which y’ are like to raise brave trophies?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I advise you (not for fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for your own sake) to forbear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for the churches, which may chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From hence, to spring a variance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raise among themselves new scruples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom common danger hardly couples.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember how, in arms and politics,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We still have worsted all your holy tricks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trepann’d your party with intrigue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took your grandees down a peg;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New modell’d th’ army, and cashier’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that to legion Smec adher’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a mere utensil o’ your church,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after left it in the lurch;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A scaffold to build up our own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when w’ had done with’t, pull’d it down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Capoch’d your rabbins of the synod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snap’d their canons with a why-not?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Grave synod men, that were rever’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For solid face and depth of beard;)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their classic model prov’d a maggot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their direct’ry an Indian Pagod;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drown’d their discipline like a kitten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On which they’d been so long a sitting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decry’d it as a holy cheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grown out of date, and obsolete;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the Saints of the first grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As casting foals of Balaam’s ass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this the Knight grew high in chafe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And staring furiously on Ralph,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He trembled, and look’d pale with ire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like ashes first, then red as fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I (quoth he) been ta’en in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for so many moons lain by’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when all other means did fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have been exchang’d for tubs of ale?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-101" id="noteref-101" epub:type="noteref">101</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not but they thought me worth a ransom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much more consid’rable and handsome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for their own sakes, and for fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were not safe when I was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now to be baffled by a scoundrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An upstart sect’ry, and a mongrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as breed out of peccant humours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our own church, like wens or tumours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like a maggot in a sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would that which gave it life devour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It never shall be done or said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With that he seiz’d upon his blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Ralpho too, as quick and bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his basket-hilt laid hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With equal readiness prepar’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To draw, and stand upon his guard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When both were parted on the sudden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hideous clamour, and a loud one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if all sorts of noise had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contracted into one loud din;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or that some member to be chosen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had got the odds above a thousand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, by the greatness of his noise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prov’d fittest for his country’s choice.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This strange surprisal put the Knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrathful Squire into a fright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though they stood prepar’d, with fatal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impetuous rancour to join battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both thought it was the wisest course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wave the fight and mount to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to secure, by swift retreating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Themselves from danger of worse beating.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet neither of them would disparage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By utt’ring of his mind, his courage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which made them stoutly keep their ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With horror and disdain wind-bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the cause of all their fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By slow degrees approach’d so near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might distinguish different noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of horns, and pans, and dogs, and boys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kettle-drums, whose sullen dub</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sounds like the hooping of a tub.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the sight appear’d in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They found it was an antique show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A triumph, that, for pomp and state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did proudest Romans emulate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as the aldermen of Rome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their foes at training overcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not enlarging territory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As some mistaken write in story),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being mounted, in their best array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a car, and who but they!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And follow’d with a world of tall-lads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That merry ditties troll’d, and ballads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did ride with many a good-morrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying, “Hey for our town!” through the borough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when this triumph drew so nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might particulars descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never saw two things so pat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all respects, as this and that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First he that led the cavalcade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore a sow-gelder’s flagellate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On which he blew as strong a levet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well-fee’d lawyer on his breviate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When over one another’s heads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They charge (three ranks at once) like Swedes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next pans and kettles of all keys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From trebles down to double base;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after them, upon a nag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That might pass for a forehand stag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cornet rode, and on his staff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A smock display’d did proudly wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bagpipes of the loudest drones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With snuffling broken-winded tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose blasts of air, in pockets shut,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sound filthier than from the gut,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make a viler noise than swine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In windy weather, when they whine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next one upon a pair of panniers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full fraught with that which for good manners</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall here be nameless, mixt with grains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he dispens’d among the swains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And busily upon the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At random round about bestow’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, mounted on a horned horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One bore a gauntlet and gilt spurs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ty’d to the pummel of a long sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He held reverst, the point turn’d downward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next after, on a raw-bon’d steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The conqueror’s standard-bearer rid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore aloft before the champion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A petticoat display’d, and rampant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near whom the Amazon triumphant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bestrid her beast, and on the rump on’t</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat face to tail, and bum to bum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warrior whilom overcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arm’d with a spindle and a distaff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, as he rode, she made him twist off;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he loiter’d, o’er her shoulder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chastis’d the reformado soldier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the dame, and round about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>March’d whifflers and staffiers on foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lackies, grooms, valets, and pages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fit and proper equipages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom some torches bore, some links,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the proud virago minx,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was both Madam and a Don,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like Nero’s Sporus, or Pope Joan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at fit periods the whole rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up their throats with clamorous shout.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Knight, transported, and the Squire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put up their weapons, and their ire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hudibras, who us’d to ponder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On such sights with judicious wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could hold no longer to impart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His animadversions, for his heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, In all my life, till now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ne’er saw so profane a show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a Paganish invention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which heathen writers often mention:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he who made it had read Goodwin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Ross, or Caelius Rhodogine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the Grecian Speeds and Stows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That best describe those ancient shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And has observ’d all fit decorums</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We find describ’d by old historians:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as the Roman conqueror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That put an end to foreign war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ent’ring the town in triumph for it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore a slave with him, in his chariot;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-102" id="noteref-102" epub:type="noteref">102</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>So this insulting female brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carries behind her here a slave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the ancients long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they in field defy’d the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung out their mantles <i xml:lang="it">della guerre</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-103" id="noteref-103" epub:type="noteref">103</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>So her proud standard-bearer here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waves on his spear, in dreadful manner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Tyrian petticoat for banner.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next links and torches, heretofore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-104" id="noteref-104" epub:type="noteref">104</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still borne before the emperor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as, in antique triumphs, eggs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were borne for mystical intrigues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s one with truncheon, like a ladle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That carries eggs too, fresh or addle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still at random, as he goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the rabble-rout bestows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralpho, You mistake the matter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all th’ antiquity you smatter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but a riding us’d of course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the grey mare’s the better horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When o’er the breeches greedy women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fight to extend their vast dominion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the cause impatient Grizel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has drubb’d her husband with bull’s pizzle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought him under covert-baron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To turn her vassal with a murrain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wives their sexes shift, like hares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride their husbands like night-mares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they, in mortal battle vanquish’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are of their charter disenfranchis’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the right of war, like gills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Condemn’d to distaff, horns, and wheels:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when men by their wives are cow’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their horns of course are understood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Hudibras, Thou still giv’st sentence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impertinently, and against sense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis not the least disparagement</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be defeated by th’ event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor to be beaten by main force;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That does not make a man the worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although his shoulders with battoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be claw’d and cudgel’d to some tune.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A taylor’s ’prentice has no hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Measure, that’s bang’d with a true yard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to turn tail, or run away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And without blows give up the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to surrender ere th’ assault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s no man’s fortune, but his fault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And renders men of honour less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all th’ adversity of success;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only unto such this show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of horns and petticoats is due.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a lesser profanation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like that the Romans call’d ovation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as ovation was allow’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For conquest purchas’d without blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So men decree these lesser shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For victory gotten without blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By dint of sharp hard words, which some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give battle with, and overcome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These mounted in a chair-curule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which moderns call a cucking-stool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>March proudly to the river’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the waves in triumph ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like dukes of Venice, who are said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Adriatic Sea to wed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have a gentler wife than those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom the State decrees those shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But both are heathenish, and come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From th’ whores of Babylon and Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the Saints should be withstood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Antichristian and lewd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we as such, should now contribute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our utmost struggling to prohibit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, they both advanc’d, and rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dog-trot through the bawling crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ attack the leader, and still prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they approach’d him breast to breast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Hudibras, with face and hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made signs for silence; which obtain’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What means (quoth he) this devil’s procession</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With men of orthodox profession?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis ethnic and idolatrous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From heathenism deriv’d to us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not the Whore of Babylon ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her horned beast astride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like this proud dame, who either is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A type of her, or she of this?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are things of superstitious function</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fit to be us’d in gospel sun-shine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is an Antichristian opera,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much us’d in midnight times of Popery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of running after self-inventions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wicked and profane intentions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To scandalize that sex for scolding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the saints are so beholden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Women, who were our first apostles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without whose aid we had been lost else;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Women, that left no stone unturn’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which the cause might be concern’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought in their children’s spoons and whistles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purchase swords, carbines, and pistols;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their husbands, cullies, and sweet-hearts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take the saints’ and churches’ parts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew several gifted brethren in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for the bishops would have been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fix’d ’em constant to the party,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With motives powerful and hearty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their husbands robb’d, and made hard shifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ administer unto their gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All they could rap, and rend, and pilfer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To scraps and ends of gold and silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubb’d down the teachers, tir’d and spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holding forth for Parliament:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pamper’d and edify’d their zeal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With marrow-puddings many a meal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And led them, with store of meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On controverted points to eat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cramm’d ’em, till their guts did ake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cawdle, custard, and plum-cake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What have they done, or what left undone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That might advance the cause at London?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>March’d rank and file, with drum and ensign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ intrench the city for defence in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rais’d rampiers with their own soft hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To put the enemy to stands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From ladies down to oyster-wenches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Labour’d like pioneers in trenches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to their pick-axes, and tools,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And help’d the men to dig like moles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not the handmaids of the city</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chose of their members a committee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For raising of a common purse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of their wages to raise horse?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And do they not as triers sit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To judge what officers are fit?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have they ⸻? At that an egg let fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hit him directly o’er the eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And running down his cheek, besmear’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With orange tawny slime his beard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But beard and slime being of one hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wound the less appear’d in view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he that on the panniers rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fly on th’ other side a load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And quickly charg’d again, gave fully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ralpho’s face another volley.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Knight was startled with the smell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for his sword began to feel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Ralpho, smother’d with the stink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasp’d his; when one that bore a link,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ sudden clapp’d his flaming cudgel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like linstock, to the horse’s touch-hole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And straight another with his flambeaux,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave Ralpho’s o’er the eye a damn’d blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beasts began to kick and fling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forc’d the rout to make a ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through which they quickly broke their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought them off from further fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though disorder’d in retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each of them stoutly kept his seat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, quitting both their swords and reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They grasp’d with all their strength the manes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, to avoid the foe’s pursuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With spurring put their cattle to’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And till all four were out of wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And danger too, ne’er look’d behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After th’ had paus’d a while, supplying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their spirits, spent with fight and flying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hudibras recruited force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of lungs, for action or discourse;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, That man is sure to lose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fouls his hands with dirty foes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For where no honour’s to be gain’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thrown away in b’ing maintain’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas ill for us we had to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With so dishonourable a foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though the law of arms doth bar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The use of venom’d shot in war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, by the nauseous smell, and noisome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their case-shot savours strong of poison;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doubtless have been chew’d with teeth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some that had a stinking breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else, when we put it to the push,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have not giv’n us such a brush.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as those poltroons that fling dirt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do but defile, but cannot hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So all the honour they have won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or we have lost, is much as one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas well we made so resolute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brave retreat, without pursuit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if we had not, we had sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much worse, to be in triumph led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than which the ancients held no state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of man’s life more unfortunate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if this bold adventure e’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do chance to reach the widow’s ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It may, b’ing destin’d to assert</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her sex’s honour, reach her heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as such homely treats (they say)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Portend good fortune, so this may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vespasian being daub’d with dirt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-105" id="noteref-105" epub:type="noteref">105</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was destin’d to the empire for’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from a scavenger did come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be a mighty prince in Rome:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And why may not this foul address</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presage in love the same success?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then let us straight, to cleanse our wounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Advance in quest of nearest ponds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after (as we first design’d)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear I’ve perform’d what she enjoin’d.</span>
