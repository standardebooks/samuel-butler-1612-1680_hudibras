				<span>The learned write, an insect breeze<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-166" id="noteref-166" epub:type="noteref">166</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but a mongrel prince of bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That falls before a storm on cows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stings the founders of his house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From whose corrupted flesh that breed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of vermin did at first proceed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, ere the storm of war broke out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Religion spawn’d a various rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of petulant capricious sects,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maggots of corrupted texts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That first run all religion down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after ev’ry swarm its own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as the Persian Magi once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon their mothers got their sons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-167" id="noteref-167" epub:type="noteref">167</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That were incapable t’ enjoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That empire any other way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Presbyter begot the other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Good Old Cause, his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bore them, like the devil’s dam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose son and husband are the same;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet no nat’ral tie of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor int’rest for the common good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could, when their profits interfer’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Get quarter for each other’s beard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when they thriv’d, they never fadg’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only by the ears engag’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like dogs that snarl about a bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And play together when they’ve none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As by their truest characters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their constant actions, plainly appears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rebellion now began, for lack</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of zeal and plunder, to grow slack;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cause and Covenant to lessen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Providence to b’ out of season:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now there was no more to purchase</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ king’s revenue, and the churches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all divided, shar’d, and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That us’d to urge the brethren on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which forc’d the stubborn’st for the Cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cross the cudgels to the laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That what by breaking them th’ had gain’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By their support might be maintain’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like thieves, that in a hemp-plot lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Secur’d against the hue-and-cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Presbyter and Independant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were now turn’d plaintiff and defendant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid out their apostolic functions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On carnal orders and injunctions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all their precious gifts and graces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On outlawries and scire facias;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Michael’s term had many a trial,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-168" id="noteref-168" epub:type="noteref">168</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worse than the Dragon and <abbr>St.</abbr> Michael,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thousands fell, in shape of fees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the bottomless abyss.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when, like brethren, and like friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They came to share their dividends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ev’ry partner to possess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His church and state joint-purchases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which the ablest saint, and best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was nam’d in trust by all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pay their money; and, instead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ev’ry brother, pass the deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He strait converted all his gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pious frauds and holy shifts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And settled all the other shares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his outward man and ’s heirs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held all they claim’d as forfeit lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deliver’d up into his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pass’d upon his conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By pre-intail of Providence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impeach’d the rest for reprobates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That had no titles to estates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But by their spiritual attaints</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Degraded from the right of saints.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This b’ing reveal’d, they now begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With law and conscience to fall on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid about as hot and brain-sick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As th’ utter barrister of Swanswick;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-169" id="noteref-169" epub:type="noteref">169</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engag’d with money-bags as bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As men with sand-bags did of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That brought the lawyers in more fees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all unsanctify’d trustees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he who had no more to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ th’ case receiv’d the overthrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, both sides having had the worst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They parted as they met at first.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor Presbyter was now reduc’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Secluded, and cashier’d, and chous’d!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn’d out, and excommunicate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all affairs of church and state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reform’d t’ a reformado saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glad to turn itinerant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stroll and teach from town to town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those he had taught up teach down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make those uses serve agen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the new-enlighten’d men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fit as when at first they were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reveal’d against the Cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damn Anabaptist and fanatic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pat as popish and prelatic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with as little variation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve for any sect i’ th’ nation.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Good Old Cause, which some believe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be the devil that tempted Eve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With knowledge, and does still invite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world to mischief with new Light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had store of money in her purse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he took her for bett’r or worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now was grown deform’d and poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fit to be turn’d out of door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Independents (whose first station</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in the rear of reformation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mongrel kind of church dragoons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That serv’d for horse and foot at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the saddle of one steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Saracen and Christian rid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were free of ev’ry spiritual order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To preach, and fight, and pray, and murder)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner got the start to lurch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both disciplines of war, and church,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And providence enough to run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chief commanders of ’em down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But carry’d on the war against</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The common enemy o’ th’ saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a while prevail’d so far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To win of them the game of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be at liberty once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ attack themselves, as th’ had before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For now there was no foe in arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ unite their factions with alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all reduc’d and overcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except their worst, themselves at home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wh’ had compass’d all they pray’d, and swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fought, and preach’d, and plunder’d for;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subdu’d the nation, church, and state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all things but their laws and hate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when they came to treat and transact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And share the spoil of all th’ had ransackt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To botch up what th’ had torn and rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Religion and the government,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They met no sooner, but prepar’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pull down all the war had spar’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agreed in nothing but t’ abolish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subvert, extirpate, and demolish:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For knaves and fools b’ing near of kin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Dutch Boors are t’ a Sooterkin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-170" id="noteref-170" epub:type="noteref">170</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both parties join’d to do their best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To damn the public interest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And herded only in consults,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To put by one another’s bolts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ out-cant the Babylonian labourers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-171" id="noteref-171" epub:type="noteref">171</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>At all their dialects of jabberers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tug at both ends of the saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tear down government and law.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as two cheats, that play one game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are both defeated of their aim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So those who play a game of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only cavil in debate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although there’s nothing lost or won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The public bus’ness is undone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which still the longer ’tis in doing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes the surer way to ruin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This, when the royalists perceiv’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Who to their faith as firmly cleav’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And own’d the right they had paid down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dearly for, the church and crown,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ united constanter, and sided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more, the more their foes divided.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though out-number’d, overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the fate of war run down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their duty never was defeated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor from their oaths and faith retreated;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For loyalty is still the same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether it win or lose the game;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True as the dial to the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although it be not shin’d upon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when these brethren in evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their adversaries, and the devil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began once more to shew them play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hopes, at least, to have a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rally’d in parades of woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And unfrequented solitudes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conven’d at midnight in outhouses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ appoint new-rising rendezvouses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, with a pertinacy unmatch’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For new recruits of danger watch’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner was one blow diverted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But up another party started;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as if nature too, in haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To furnish out supplies as fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her time, had turn’d destruction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ a new and numerous production,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner those were overcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But up rose others in their room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, like the Christian faith, increast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more, the more they were supprest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom neither chains, nor transportation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proscription, sale, or confiscation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor all the desperate events</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of former try’d experiments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wounds could terrify, nor mangling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave off loyalty and dangling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor death (with all his bones) affright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From vent’ring to maintain the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From staking life and fortune down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst all together, for the crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept the title of their cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From forfeiture, like claims in laws:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prov’d no prosp’rous usurpation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever settle in the nation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, in spite of force and treason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They put their loyalty in possession;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by their constancy and faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Destroy’d the mighty men of Gath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Toss’d in a furious hurricane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did Oliver give up his reign;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-172" id="noteref-172" epub:type="noteref">172</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And was believ’d, as well by saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As mortal men and miscreants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To founder in the Stygian ferry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he was retriev’d by Sterry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, in a false erroneous dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mistook the New Jerusalem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Profanely for th’ apocryphal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>False Heaven at the end o’ th’ hall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-173" id="noteref-173" epub:type="noteref">173</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither it was decreed by fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His precious reliques to translate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Romulus was seen before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>B’ as orthodox a senator,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-174" id="noteref-174" epub:type="noteref">174</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>From whose divine illumination</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stole the Pagan revelation.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next him his son and heir apparent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Succeeded, though a lame vicegerent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-175" id="noteref-175" epub:type="noteref">175</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first laid by the Parliament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only crutch on which he leant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then sunk underneath the state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rode him above horseman’s weight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the saints began their reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which th’ had yearn’d so long in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt such bowel-hankerings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see an empire all of kings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deliver’d from the Egyptian awe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of justice, government, and law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And free t’ erect what spiritual cantons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should be reveal’d, or gospel Hans-Towns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To edify upon the ruins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of John of Leyden’s old out-goings;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-176" id="noteref-176" epub:type="noteref">176</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who for a weather-cock hung up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the mother church’s top:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was made a type, by Providence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all their revelations since;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now fulfill’d by his successors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who equally mistook their measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when they came to shape the model,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one could fit another’s noddle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But found their light and gifts more wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From fadging than th’ unsanctify’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While ev’ry individual brother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strove hand to fist against another;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still the maddest, and most crackt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were found the busiest to transact:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though most hands dispatch apace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make light work, (the proverb says,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet many diff’rent intellects</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are found t’ have contrary effects;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many heads t’ obstruct intrigues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As slowest insects have most legs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some were for setting up a king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all the rest for no such thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless King Jesus. Others tamper’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Fleetwood, Desborough, and Lambert;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for the Rump, and some, more crafty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Agitators, and the safety;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for the gospel, and massacres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of spiritual affidavit-makers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That swore to any human regence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oaths of supremacy and allegiance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, though the ablest swearing saint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That vouch’d the bulls o’ the Covenant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others for pulling down th’ high places</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of synods and provincial classes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That us’d to make such hostile inroads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the saints, like bloody Nimrods:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for fulfilling prophecies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And th’ expiration of th’ excise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some against th’ Egyptian bondage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of holy-days, and paying poundage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for the cutting down of groves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rectifying bakers’ loaves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some for finding out expedients</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the slav’ry of obedience:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were for gospel ministers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some for red-coat seculars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As men most fit t’ hold forth the word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wield the one and th’ other sword:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were for carrying on the work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the Pope, and some the Turk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for engaging to suppress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Camisado of surplices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gifts and dispensations hinder’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn’d to th’ outward man the inward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More proper for the cloudy night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of popery than gospel light:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others were for abolishing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That tool of matrimony, a ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which th’ unsanctify’d bridegroom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is marry’d only to a thumb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As wise as ringing of a pig,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That us’d to break up ground, and dig;)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bride to nothing but her will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That nulls the after-marriage still:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were for th’ utter extirpation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of linsey-woolsey in the nation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some against all idolizing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cross in shops-books, or baptizing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others to make all things recant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Christian or surname of saint;</span>

				<span>And force all churches, streets, and towns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The holy title to renounce:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some ’gainst a third estate of souls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bringing down the price of coals:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some for abolishing black-pudding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eating nothing with the blood in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To abrogate them roots and branches;</span>

				<span>While others were for eating haunches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of warriors, and now and then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flesh of kings and mighty men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some for breaking of their bones</span>

				<span>With rods of ir’n, by secret ones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thrashing mountains, and with spells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hallowing carriers’ packs and bells:</span>

				<span>Things that the legend never heard of,</span>

			<p>
				<span>The quacks of government (who sate</span>

				<span>At th’ unregarded helm of state,</span>

				<span>’Mong these there was a politician<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-177" id="noteref-177" epub:type="noteref">177</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>With more heads than a beast in vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more intrigues in ev’ry one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the whores of Babylon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So politic, as if one eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the other were a spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, to trepan the one to think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other blind, both strove to blink;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his dark pragmatic way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As busy as a child at play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>H’ had seen three governments run down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had a hand in ev’ry one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was for ’em and against ’em all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But barb’rous when they came to fall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, by trepanning th’ old to ruin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made his int’rest with the new one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play’d true and faithful, though against</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His conscience, and was still advanc’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by the witchcraft of rebellion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transform’d t’ a feeble state-camelion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By giving aim from side to side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never fail’d to save his tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But got the start of ev’ry state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at a change ne’er came too late;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cou’d turn his word, and oath, and faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As many ways as in a lathe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By turning, wriggle, like a screw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Int’ highest trust, and out, for new:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when h’ had happily incurr’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of hemp, to be preferr’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pass’d upon a government,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He pay’d his trick, and out he went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But being out, and out of hopes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mount his ladder (more) of ropes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would strive to raise himself upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The public ruin, and his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So little did he understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The desp’rate feats he took in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when h’ had got himself a name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fraud and tricks, he spoil’d his game;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had forc’d his neck into a noose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shew his play at fast and loose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he chanc’d t’ escape, mistook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For art and subtlety, his luck.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So right his judgment was cut fit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a tally to his wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And both together most profound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At deeds of darkness under-ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As th’ earth is easiest undermin’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By vermin impotent and blind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By all these arts, and many more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>H’ had practis’d long and much before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our state artificer foresaw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which way the world began to draw.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as old sinners have all points</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ compass in their bones and joints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can by their pangs and aches find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All turns and changes of the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And better than by Napier’s bones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-178" id="noteref-178" epub:type="noteref">178</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feel in their own the age of moons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So guilty sinners in a state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can by their crimes prognosticate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in their consciences feel pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some days before a show’r of rain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He therefore wisely cast about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All ways he could, t’ ensure his throat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither came, t’ observe and smoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What courses other riskers took;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the utmost do his best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save himself, and hang the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To match this saint, there was another<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-179" id="noteref-179" epub:type="noteref">179</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As busy and perverse a brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An haberdasher of small wares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In politics and state affairs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More Jew than Rabbi AchitopheL,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And better gifted to rebel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when h’ had taught his tribe to ’spouse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cause, aloft, upon one house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He scorn’d to set his own in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But try’d another, and went farther;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So suddenly addicted still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ’s only principle, his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whatsoe’er it chanc’d to prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor force of argument could move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor law, nor cavalcade of Holborn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could render half a grain less stubborn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he at any time would hang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For th’ opportunity t’ harangue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rather on a gibbet dangle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than miss his dear delight, to wrangle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which his parts were so accomplisht,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, right or wrong, he ne’er was nonplust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still his tongue ran on, the less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of weight it bore, with greater ease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with its everlasting clack</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set all men’s ears upon the rack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner could a hint appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But up he started to picqueer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made the stoutest yield to mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he engag’d in controversy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not by the force of carnal reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But indefatigable teasing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With vollies of eternal babble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clamour, more unanswerable:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though his topics, frail and weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could ne’er amount above a freak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He still maintain’d ’em, like his faults,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the desp’ratest assaults;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And back’d their feeble want of sense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With greater heat and confidence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As bones of Hectors, when they differ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more they’re cudgel’d, grow the stiffer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet when his profit moderated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fury of his heat abated;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For nothing but his interest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could lay his devil of contest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was his choice, or chance, or curse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ espouse the cause for better or worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with his worldly goods and wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soul and body worshipp’d it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he found the sullen trapes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Possess’d with the devil, worms, and claps;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Trojan mare in foal, with Greeks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-180" id="noteref-180" epub:type="noteref">180</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not half so full of jadish tricks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though squeamish in her outward woman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As loose and rampant as Doll Common,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He still resolv’d to mend the matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ adhere and cleave the obstinater;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still the skittisher and looser</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her freaks appear’d to sit the closer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fools are stubborn in their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As coins are harden’d by th’ allay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And obstinacy’s ne’er so stiff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when ’tis in a wrong belief.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These two, with others, being met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close in consultation set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After a discontented pause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not without sufficient cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The orator we nam’d of late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less troubled with the pangs of state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than with his own impatience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give himself first audience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After he had a while look’d wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last broke silence, and the ice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, There’s nothing makes me doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our last outgoings brought about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than to see the characters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of real jealousies and fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not feign’d, as once, but sadly horrid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scor’d upon ev’ry member’s forehead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, ’cause the clouds are drawn together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And threaten sudden change of weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feel pangs and aches of state-turns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And revolutions in their corns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, since our workings-out are cross’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throw up the cause before ’tis lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it to run away we meant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, taking of the Covenant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lamest cripples of the brothers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took oaths to run before all others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in their own sense only swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To strive to run away before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now would prove that words and oath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engage us to renounce them both?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis true, the cause is in the lurch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between a right and mongrel-church:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Presbyter and Independent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stickle which shall make an end on’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As ’twas made out to us the last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expedient⁠—(I mean Marg’ret’s Fast,)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-181" id="noteref-181" epub:type="noteref">181</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Providence had been suborn’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What answer was to be return’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else why should tumults fright us now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have so many times come through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And understand as well to tame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when they serve our turns t’ inflame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have prov’d how inconsiderable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are all engagements of the rabble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose frenzies must be reconcil’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With drums and rattles, like a child;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But never prov’d so prosperous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when they were led on by us:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all our scourging of religion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began with tumult and sedition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When hurricanes of fierce commotion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became strong motives to devotion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As carnal seamen in a storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn pious converts, and reform;)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When rusty weapons, with chalk’d edges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maintain’d our feeble privileges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brown-bills levy’d in the city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made bills to pass the grand committee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When zeal, with aged clubs and gleaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave chase to rochets and white sleeves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made the church, and state, and laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Submit t’ old iron and the cause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as we thriv’d by tumults then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So might we better now agen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we knew how, as then we did,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To use them rightly in our need:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tumults, by which the mutinous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betray themselves instead of us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hollow-hearted, disaffected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close malignant, are detected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lay their lives and fortunes down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pledges to secure our own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And freely sacrifice their ears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ appease our jealousies and fears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet for all these providences</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ are offer’d, if we had our senses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We idly sit like stupid blockheads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hands committed to our pockets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nothing but our tongues at large,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get the wretches a discharge:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like men condemn’d to thunder-bolts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, ere the blow, become mere dolts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fools besotted with their crimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That know not how to shift betimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neither have the hearts to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wit enough to run away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, if we could resolve on either,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might stand or fall at least together;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mean or trivial solaces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To partners in extreme distress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who used to lessen their despairs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By parting them int’ equal shares;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if the more they were to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They felt the weight the easier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ev’ry one the gentler hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more he took his turn among.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ’tis not come to that, as yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we had courage left, or wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, when our fate can be no worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are fitted for the bravest course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have time to rally, and prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our last and best defence, despair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Despair, by which the gallant’st feats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have been achiev’d in greatest straits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And horrid’st danger safely wav’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By being courageously outbrav’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wounds by wider wounds are heal’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poisons by themselves expell’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so they might be now agen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we were, what we should be, men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not so dully desperate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To side against ourselves with fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As criminals, condemn’d to suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are blinded first, and then turn’d over.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This comes of breaking covenants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And setting up exaunts of saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fine, like aldermen, for grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be excus’d the efficace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For spiritual men are too transcendent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That mount their banks for Independent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hang like Mahomet i’ th’ air,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-182" id="noteref-182" epub:type="noteref">182</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or <abbr>St.</abbr> Ignatius at his prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By pure geometry, and hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dependence upon church or state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disdain the pedantry o’ th’ letter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since obedience is better</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The Scripture says) than sacrifice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presume the less on’t will suffice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scorn to have the moderat’st stints</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prescrib’d their peremptory hints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or any opinion, true or false,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Declar’d as such, in doctrinals;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left at large to make their best on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without b’ing call’d t’ account or question:</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And bid themselves turn back agen</span>

				<span>Lord May’rs of New Jerusalem;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But look so big and over-grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scorn their edifiers t’ own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who taught them all their sprinkling lessons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their tones, and sanctified expressions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bestow’d their gifts upon a saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like charity on those that want;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learn’d th’ apocryphal bigots</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ inspire themselves with short-hand notes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which they scorn and hate them worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than dogs and cats do sow-gelders.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who first bred them up to pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And teach, the House of Commons’ way?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where had they all their gifted phrases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But from our Calamys and Cases?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without whose sprinkling and sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who e’er had heard of Nye or Owen?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their dispensations had been stifled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for our Adoniram Byfield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had they not begun the war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ had ne’er been sainted, as they are:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For saints in peace degenerate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dwindle down to reprobate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their zeal corrupts like standing water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In th’ intervals of war and slaughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abates the sharpness of its edge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the power of sacrilege.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though they’ve tricks to cast their sins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As easy as serpents do their skins,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-183" id="noteref-183" epub:type="noteref">183</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in a while grow out agen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peace they turn mere carnal men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the most refin’d of saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As naturally grow miscreants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As barnacles turn Soland geese</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In th’ Islands of the Orcades.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-184" id="noteref-184" epub:type="noteref">184</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their dispensation’s but a ticket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For their conforming to the wicked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whom the greatest difference</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies more in words, and show, than sense.</span>

				<span>For as the Pope, that keeps the gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven, wears three crowns of state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So he that keeps the gate of hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud Cerberus, wears three heads as well:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-185" id="noteref-185" epub:type="noteref">185</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if the world has any troth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some have been canoniz’d in both.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that which does them greatest harm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their spiritual gizzards are too warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which puts the overheated sots</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fevers still, like other goats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though the whore bends hereticks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With flames of fire, like crooked sticks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our schismatics so vastly differ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ hotter th’ are, they grow the stiffer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still setting off their spiritual goods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fierce and pertinacious feuds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For zeal’s a dreadful termagant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That teaches saints to tear and rant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Independents to profess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doctrine of dependences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns meek, and secret, sneaking ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To raw-heads fierce and bloody bones:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, not content with endless quarrels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the wicked and their morals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Gibellines, for want of Guelphs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-186" id="noteref-186" epub:type="noteref">186</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divert their rage upon themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the war is not between</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brethren and the men of sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But saint and saint, to spill the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one another’s brotherhood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where neither side can lay pretence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To liberty of conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or zealous suff’ring for the cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gain one groat’s worth of applause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though endur’d with resolution,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twill ne’er amount to persecution.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall precious saints and secret ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break one another’s outward bones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eat the flesh of brethren,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of kings and mighty men?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When fiends agree among themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall they be found the greatest elves?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Bel’s at union with the Dragon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Baal-Peor friends with Dagon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When savage bears agree with bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall secret ones lug saints by th’ ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not atone their fatal wrath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When common danger threatens both?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall mastiffs, by the collar pull’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engag’d with bulls, let go their hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saints, whose necks are pawn’d at stake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No notice of the danger take?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But though no pow’r of heav’n or hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can pacify fanatic zeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who would not guess there might be hopes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fear of gallowses and ropes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before their eyes, might reconcile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their animosities a while;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At least until they’d a clear stage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And equal freedom to engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the danger of surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By both our common enemies?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This none but we alone could doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who understand their working-out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And know them, both in soul and conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giv’n up t’ as reprobate a nonsense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As spiritual outlaws, whom the pow’r</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of miracle can ne’er restore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We, whom at first they set up under,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In revelation only of plunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who since have had so many trials</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their encroaching self-denials,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rook’d upon us with design</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To out-reform, and undermine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took all our interest and commands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perfidiously out of our hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Involv’d us in the guilt of blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the motive gains allow’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made us serve as ministerial,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like younger sons of Father Belial;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, for all th’ inhuman wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ had done us and the cause so long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We never fail’d to carry on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The work still as we had begun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But true and faithfully obey’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neither preach’d them hurt, nor pray’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor troubled them to crop our ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor hang us, like the cavaliers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor put them to the charge of gaols,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find us pill’ries and carts’ tails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hangmen’s wages, which the state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was forc’d (before them) to be at;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cut, like tallies, to the stumps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our ears for keeping true accompts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And burnt our vessels, like a new</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seal’d peck, or bushel, for b’ing true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hand in hand, like faithful brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held for the cause against all others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disdaining equally to yield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One syllable of what we held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though we differ’d now and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Bout outward things, and outward men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our inward men and constant frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of spirit, still were near the same;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And till they first began to cant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sprinkle down the Covenant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We ne’er had call in any place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dream’d of teaching down free grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But join’d our gifts perpetually</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the common enemy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although ’twas ours and their opinion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each other’s Church was but a Rimmon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, for all this gospel-union,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And outward show of church-communion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ll ne’er admit us to our shares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ruling church or state affairs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor give us leave t’ absolve, or sentence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ our own conditions of repentance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shar’d our dividend o’ th’ crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We had so painfully preach’d down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forc’d us, though against the grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ have calls to teach it up again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’twas but justice to restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wrongs we had receiv’d before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when ’twas held forth in our way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ had been ungrateful not to pay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, for the right w’ have done the nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have earn’d our temporal salvation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put our vessels in a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more to come again in play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if the turning of us out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has brought this providence about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that our only suffering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is able to bring in the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What would our actions not have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had we been suffer’d to go on?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore may pretend t’ a share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At least, in carrying on th’ affair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whether that be so, or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ have done enough to have it thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that’s as good as if w’ had done ’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And easier pass’t upon account:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if it be but half deny’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis half as good as justify’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world is nat’rally averse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the truth it sees or hears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But swallows nonsense, and a lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With greediness and gluttony;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though it have the pique, and long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis still for something in the wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As women long, when they’re with child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For things extravagant and wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For meats ridiculous and fulsome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But seldom any thing that’s wholesome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like the world, men’s jobbernoles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn round upon their ears, the poles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what they’re confidently told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By no sense else can be controll’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this, perhaps, may prove the means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more to hedge in providence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as relapses make diseases</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More desp’rate than their first accesses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we but get again in pow’r,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our work is easier than before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we more ready and expert</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ th’ mystery to do our part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We, who did rather undertake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first war to create than make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when of nothing ’twas begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rais’d funds as strange to carry ’t on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trepann’d the state, and fac’d it down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With plots and projects of our own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if we did such feats at first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What can we now we’re better vers’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have a freer latitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than sinners give themselves, allow’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore likeliest to bring in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On fairest terms, our discipline;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which it was reveal’d long since,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We were ordain’d by Providence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When three saints’ ears our predecessors,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-187" id="noteref-187" epub:type="noteref">187</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cause’s primitive confessors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>B’ing crucify’d, the nation stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In just so many years of blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, multiply’d by six, exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The perfect number of the beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prov’d that we must be the men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring this work about agen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those who laid the first foundation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Complete the thorough Reformation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who have gifts to carry on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great a work, but we alone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What churches have such able pastors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And precious, powerful, preaching masters?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Possess’d with absolute dominions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er brethren’s purses and opinions?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trusted with the double keys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven and their warehouses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, when the cause is in distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can furnish out what sums they please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That brooding lie in bankers’ hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be dispos’d at their commands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And daily increase and multiply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With doctrine, use, and usury:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can fetch in parties (as in war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All other heads of cattle are)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From th’ enemy of all religions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as high and low conditions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And share them, from blue ribands, down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all blue aprons in the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From ladies hurried in calleches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cor’nets at their footmens’ breeches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bawds as fat as Mother Nab,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All guts and belly, like a crab.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our party’s great, and better ty’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With oaths and trade than any side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has one considerable improvement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To double fortify the Cov’nant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean our Covenant to purchase</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delinquents’ titles, and the churches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pass in sale, from hand to hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among ourselves, for current land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rise or fall, like Indian actions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to the rate of factions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our best reserve for Reformation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When new out-goings give occasion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That keeps the loins of brethren girt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Covenant (their creed) t’ assert;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when th’ have pack’d a Parliament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will once more try th’ expedient:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who can already muster friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve for members, to our ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That represent no part o’ th’ nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Fisher’s-Folly congregation;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-188" id="noteref-188" epub:type="noteref">188</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are only tools to our intrigues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sit like geese to hatch our eggs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, by their precedents of wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ out-fast, out-loiter, and out-sit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can order matters underhand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To put all bus’ness to a stand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay public bills aside for private,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make ’em one another drive out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divert the great and necessary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trifles to contest and vary;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make the nation represent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And serve for us in Parliament;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut out more work than can be done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Plato’s year, but finish none,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-189" id="noteref-189" epub:type="noteref">189</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless it be the Bulls of Lenthal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That always pass’d for fundamental;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can set up grandee ’gainst grandee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To squander time away, and bandy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make Lords and Commoners lay sieges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one another’s privileges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, rather than compound the quarrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engage to th’ inevitable peril</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of both their ruins, th’ only scope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And consolation of our hope;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who though we do not play the game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assist as much by giving aim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can introduce our ancient arts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For heads of factions t’ act their parts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know what a leading voice is worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seconding, a third, or fourth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How much a casting voice comes to,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That turns up trump of ay, or no;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, by adjusting all at th’ end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Share ev’ry one his dividend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An art that so much study cost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now’s in danger to be lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless our ancient virtuosos,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That found it out, get into th’ Houses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These are the courses that we took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To carry things by hook or crook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And practis’d down from forty-four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they turn’d us out of door:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides the herds of Boutefeus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We set on work without the House;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When ev’ry knight and citizen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept legislative journeymen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring them in intelligence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all points of the rabble’s sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fill the lobbies of both Houses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With politic important buzzes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set committees of cabals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pack designs without the walls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Examine, and draw up all news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fit it to our present use:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agree upon the plot o’ th’ farce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ev’ry one his part rehearse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make Q’s of answers, to waylay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What th’ other party’s like to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What repartees and smart reflections,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be return’d to all objections;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who shall break the master-jest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what, and how, upon the rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help pamphlets out, with safe editions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of proper slanders and seditions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And treason for a token send,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By letter to a country friend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disperse lampoons, the only wit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men, like burglary, commit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wit falser than a padder’s face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all its owner does betrays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who therefore dares not trust it when</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’s in his calling to be seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disperse the dung on barren earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring new weeds of discord forth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be sure to keep up congregations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In spite of laws and proclamations;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For charlatans can do no good</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they’re mounted in a crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they’re punish’d, all the hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but to fare the better for ’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As long as confessors are sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of double pay for all th’ endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what they earn in persecution,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are paid t’ a groat in contribution;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence some tub-holders-forth have made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In powd’ring-tubs their richest trade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while they kept their shops in prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have found their prices strangely risen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disdain to own the least regret</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the Christian blood w’ have let;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twill save our credit, and maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our title to do so again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That needs not cost one dram of sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But pertinacious impudence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our constancy t’ our principles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In time will wear out all things else;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like marble statues rubb’d in pieces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With gallantry of pilgrims’ kisses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While those who turn and wind their oaths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have swell’d and sunk, like other froths;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prevail’d a while, but ’twas not long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before from world to world they swung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they had turn’d from side to side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the changelings liv’d, they dy’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, th’ impatient states-monger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could now contain himself no longer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had not spar’d to shew his piques</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against th’ haranguer’s politics,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With smart remarks of leering faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And annotations of grimaces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After h’ had administer’d a dose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of snuff mundungus to his nose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And powder’d th’ inside of his skull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of th’ outward jobbernol,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shook it with a scornful look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On th’ adversary, and thus he spoke:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In dressing a calf’s head, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tongue and brains together go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both keep so great a distance here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis strange if ever they come near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who did ever play his gambols</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such insufferable rambles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make the bringing in the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keeping of him out, one thing?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which none could do but those that swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ as point-blank nonsense heretofore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to defend was to invade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to assassinate, to aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless, because you drove him out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(And that was never made a doubt,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No pow’r is able to restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring him in, but on your score:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spiritual doctrine, that conduces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most properly to all your uses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis true, a scorpion’s oil is said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cure the wounds the vermin made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weapons, drest with salves, restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heal the hurts they gave before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whether Presbyterians have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much good nature as the salve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or virtue in them as the vermin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those who have try’d them can determine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indeed, ’tis pity you should miss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ arrears of all your services,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for th’ eternal obligation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y’ have laid upon th’ ungrateful nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be us’d so unconscionably hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As not to find a just reward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For letting rapine loose, and murther,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rage just so far, but no further;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And setting all the land on fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To burn ’t to a scantling, but no higher;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For vent’ring to assassinate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cut the throats of church and state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not be allow’d the fittest men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take the charge of both agen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Especially, that have the grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of self-denying, gifted face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who when your projects have miscarry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can lay them, with undaunted forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On those you painfully trepann’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sprinkled in at second-hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we have been, to share the guilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Christian blood, devoutly spilt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so our ignorance was flamm’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To damn ourselves t’ avoid being damn’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till finding your old foe, the hangman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was like to lurch you at back-gammon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And win your necks upon the set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as ours, who did but bet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For he had drawn your ears before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nick’d them on the self-same score,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We threw the box and dice away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before y’ had lost us at foul play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought you down to rook, and lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fancy only, on the by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redeem’d your forfeit jobbernoles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From perching upon lofty poles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rescu’d all your outward traitors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From hanging up like alligators;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which ingeniously y’ have shew’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your Presbyterian gratitude;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would freely have paid us home in kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not have been one rope behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those were your motives to divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scruple on the other side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To turn your zealous frauds, and force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fits of conscience and remorse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be convinc’d they were in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And face about for new again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truth no more unveil’d your eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than maggots are convinc’d to flies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore all your lights and calls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but apocryphal and false,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To charge us with the consequences</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all your native insolences,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to your own imperious wills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid law and gospel neck and heels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corrupted the Old Testament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve the New for precedent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ amend its errors, and defects,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With murther, and rebellion-texts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which there is not any one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the Book to sow upon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore (from your tribe) the Jews</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held Christian doctrine forth, and use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Mahomet (your chief) began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mix them in the Alcoran;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Denounc’d and pray’d, with fierce devotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bended elbows on the cushion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stole from the beggars all your tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gifted mortifying groans;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had lights where better eyes were blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pigs are said to see the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill’d Bedlam with predestination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Knightsbridge with illumination;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made children, with your tones to run for’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As bad as Bloody-bones, or Lunsford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While women, great with child, miscarry’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For being to malignants marry’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transform’d all wives to Dallilahs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose husbands were not for the cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn’d the men to ten-horn’d cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because they came not out to battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made tailors’ ’prentices turn heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear of being transform’d to Meroz;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rather forfeit their indentures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than not espouse the saints’ adventures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could transubstantiate, metamorphose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And charm whole herds of beasts, like Orpheus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enchant the king’s and church’s lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ obey and follow your commands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And settle on a new freehold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Marcly-Hill had done of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could turn the Covenant, and translate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gospel into spoons and plate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expound upon all merchants’ cashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And open th’ intricatest places?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could catechize a money-box,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prove all pouches orthodox;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the cause became a Damon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Pythias the wicked Mammon:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet, in spite of all your charms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To conjure legion up in arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raise more devils in the rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than e’er y’ were able to cast out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y’ have been reduc’d, and by those fools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bred up (you say) in your own schools;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, though but gifted at your feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have made it plain, they have more wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By whom y’ have been so oft trepann’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And held forth out of all command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out-gifted, out-impuls’d, out-done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out-reveal’d at carryings-on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all your dispensations worm’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out-providenc’d, and out-reform’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ejected out of church and state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all things, but the people’s hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spirited out of th’ enjoyments</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of precious, edifying employments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By those who lodg’d their gifts and graces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like better bowlers, in your places:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All which you bore with resolution,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charg’d on th’ accompt of persecution;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though most righteously opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against your wills, still acquiesc’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never hum’d and hah’d sedition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor snuffled treason, nor misprision:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is, because you never durst;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For had you preach’d and pray’d your worst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! you were no longer able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To raise your posse of the rabble:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One single red-coat sentinel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out-charm’d the magic of the spell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, with his squirt-fire, could disperse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole troops with chapter rais’d and verse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We knew too well those tricks of yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave it ever in your powers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or trust our safeties, or undoings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To your disposing of out-goings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to your ordering providence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One farthing’s worth of consequence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For had you pow’r to undermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or wit to carry a design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or correspondence to trepan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inveigle, or betray one man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s nothing else that intervenes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bars your zeal to use the means;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore wondrous like, no doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring in kings, or keep them out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave undertakers to restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could not keep yourselves in pow’r;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ advance the int’rests of the crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wanted wit to keep your own!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis true, you have (for I’d be loth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wrong ye) done your parts in both,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep him out, and bring him in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As grace is introduc’d by sin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’twas your zealous want of sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sanctify’d impertinence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your carrying business in a huddle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That forc’d our rulers to new-model;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oblig’d the state to tack about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn you, root and branch, all out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reformado, one and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ your great croysado-general:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-190" id="noteref-190" epub:type="noteref">190</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your greedy slav’ring to devour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before ’twas in your clutches, pow’r,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sprung the game you were to set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before y’ had time to draw the net;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your spite to see the church’s lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divided into other hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all your sacrilegious ventures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid out in tickets and debentures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your envy to be sprinkled down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By under-churches in the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no course us’d to stop their mouths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor th’ Independents’ spreading growths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All which consider’d, ’tis more true</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None bring him in so much as you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have prevail’d beyond their plots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their midnight juntos, and seal’d knots;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thrive more by your zealous piques,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all their own rash politics.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you this way may claim a share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In carrying (as you brag) th’ affair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else frogs and toads, that croak’d the Jews</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Pharaoh and his brick-kilns loose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flies and mange, that set them free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From task-masters and slavery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were likelier to do the feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any indiff’rent man’s conceit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who e’er heard of restoration</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until your thorough reformation?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is, the king’s and church’s lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were sequester’d int’ other hands:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For only then, and not before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your eyes were open’d to restore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the work was carrying on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cross’d it, but yourselves alone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As by a world of hints appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All plain and extant as your ears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But first, o’ th’ first: The Isle of Wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will rise up, if you should deny ’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Henderson, and th’ other masses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were sent to cap texts, and put cases;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pass for deep and learned scholars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although but paltry Ob and Sollers:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-191" id="noteref-191" epub:type="noteref">191</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if th’ unseasonable fools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been a coursing in the schools;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until th’ had prov’d the devil author</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’ th’ Covenant, and the Cause his daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when they charg’d him with the guilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the blood that had been spilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They did not mean he wrought th’ effusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In person, like Sir Pride, or Hughson,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-192" id="noteref-192" epub:type="noteref">192</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only those who first begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quarrel were by him set on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who could those be but the saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those reformation termagants?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But ere this pass’d, the wise debate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spent so much time, it grew too late;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Oliver had gotten ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ inclose him with his warriors round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had brought his Providence about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn’d th’ untimely sophists out.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor had the Uxbridge bus’ness less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nonsense in ’t, or sottishness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from a scoundrel holderforth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scum as well as son o’ th’ earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your mighty senators took law</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his command, were forc’d t’ withdraw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sacrifice the peace o’ th’ nation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To doctrine, use, and application.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when the Scots, your constant cronies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ espousers of your cause and monies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had so often, in your aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many ways been soundly paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came in at last for better ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prove themselves your trusty friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You basely left them, and the church</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They train’d you up to, in the lurch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And suffer’d your own tribe of Christians</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fall before, as true Philistines.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This shews what utensils y’ have been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring the King’s concernments in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is so far from being true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That none but he can bring in you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he take you into trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will find you most exactly just;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as will punctually repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With double interest, and betray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that I think those pantomimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who vary action with the times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are less ingenious in their art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than those who dully act one part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or those who turn from side to side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More guilty than the wind and tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All countries are a wise man’s home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so are governments to some,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who change them for the same intrigues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That statesmen use in breaking leagues:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While others, in old faiths and troths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look odd as out-of-fashion’d cloths;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nastier in an old opinion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than those who never shift their linen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For true and faithful’s sure to lose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which way soever the game goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whether parties lose or win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is always nick’d, or else hedg’d in:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While pow’r usurp’d, like stol’n delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is more bewitching than the right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the times begin to alter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None rise so high as from the halter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so may we, if w’ have but sense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To use the necessary means;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not your usual stratagems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one another, lights and dreams:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stand on terms as positive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if we did not take, but give:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up the Covenant on crutches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst those who have us in their clutches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dream of pulling churches down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before w’ are sure to prop our own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your constant method of proceeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the carnal means of heeding;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ’twixt your inward sense and outward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are worse, than if y’ had none, accoutred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I grant, all courses are in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless we can get in again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only way that’s left us now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all the difficulty’s how.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis true, w’ have money, th’ only pow’r</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all mankind falls down before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Money, that, like the swords of kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the last reason of all things;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore need not doubt our play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has all advantages that way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As long as men have faith to sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meet with those that can pay well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose half-starv’d pride, and avarice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One church and state will not suffice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ expose to sale, beside the wages</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of storing plagues to after-ages.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor is our money less our own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than ’twas before we laid it down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’twill return, and turn t’ account,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we are brought, in play upon ’t:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or but, by casting knaves, get in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What pow’r can hinder us to win?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know the arts we us’d before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peace and war, and something more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by th’ unfortunate events,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can mend our next experiments:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when w’ are taken into trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How easy are the wisest choust?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who see but th’ outsides of our feats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not their secret springs and weights;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while they’re busy at their ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can carry what designs we please?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How easy is ’t to serve for agents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prosecute our old engagements?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the good old cause on foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And present pow’r from taking root?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inflame them both with false alarms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of plots and parties taking arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the nation’s wounds too wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From healing up of side to side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Profess the passionat’st concerns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For both their interests by turns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only way to improve our own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By dealing faithfully with none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As bowls run true, by being made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On purpose false, and to be sway’d:)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if we should be true to either,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twould turn us out of both together;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore have no other means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stand upon our own defence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But keeping up our ancient party</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vigour, confident and hearty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reconcile our late dissenters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our brethren, though by other venters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unite them, and their different maggots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As long and short sticks are in faggots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make them join again as close</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when they first began t’ espouse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Erect them into separate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New Jewish tribes, in church and state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To join in marriage and commerce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only among themselves converse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that are not of their mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make enemies to all mankind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take all religions in, and stickle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From conclave down to conventicle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agreeing still, or disagreeing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to the light in being.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes for liberty of conscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spiritual mis-rule, in one sense;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in another quite contrary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dispensations chance to vary;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stand for, as the times will bear it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All contradictions of the spirit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Protect their emissaries empower’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To preach sedition and the word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they’re hamper’d by the laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Release the lab’rers for the cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn the persecution back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On those that made the first attack;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep them equally in awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From breaking or maintaining law;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they have their fits too soon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the full-tides of the moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put off their zeal t’ a fitter season</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sowing faction in and treason;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keep them hooded, and their churches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like hawks from baiting on their perches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, when the blessed time shall come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of quitting Babylon and Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They may be ready to restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their own fifth monarchy once more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile be better arm’d to fence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against revolts of Providence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By watching narrowly, and snapping</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All blind sides of it, they happen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if success could make us saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ruin turn’d us miscreants:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A scandal that would fall too hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a few, and unprepar’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These are the courses we must run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spite of our hearts, or be undone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not to stand on terms and freaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before we have secur’d our necks:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But do our work, as out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As stars by day, and suns by night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All licence of the people own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In opposition to the crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for the crown as fiercely side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The head and body to divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The end of all we first design’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that yet remains behind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be sure to spare no public rapine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all emergencies, that happen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’tis as easy to supplant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Authority as men in want;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As some of us, in trusts, have made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one hand with the other trade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gain’d vastly by their joint endeavour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The right a thief, the left receiver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what the one, by tricks, forestall’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other, by as sly, retail’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For gain has wonderful effects</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ improve the factory of sects;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rule of faith in all professions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And great Diana of the Ephesians;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence turning of religion ’s made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The means to turn and wind a trade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though some change it for the worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They put themselves into a course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And draw in store of customers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thrive the better in commerce:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all religions flock together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like tame and wild fowl of a feather;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To nab the itches of their sects,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As jades do one another’s necks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence ’tis, hypocrisy as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will serve t’ improve a church as zeal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As persecution or promotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do equally advance devotion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let business, like ill watches, go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometime too fast, sometime too slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For things in order are put out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So easy, ease itself will do’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the feat’s design’d and meant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What miracle can bar th’ event?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’tis more easy to betray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than ruin any other way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All possible occasions start</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weightiest matters to divert;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obstruct, perplex, distract, entangle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lay perpetual trains to wrangle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in affairs of less import,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That neither do us good nor hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they receive as little by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out-fawn as much, and out-comply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seem as scrupulously just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bait our hooks for greater trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still be careful to cry down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All public actions, though our own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The least miscarriage aggravate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And charge it all upon the state:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Express the horrid’st detestation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pity the distracted nation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell stories scandalous and false,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ th’ proper language of cabals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all a subtle statesman says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is half in words, and half in face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As Spaniards talk in dialogues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heads and shoulders, nods and shrugs:)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entrust it under solemn vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of mum, and silence, and the rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be retail’d again in whispers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For th’ easy credulous to disperse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus far the statesman⁠—when a shout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard at a distance, put him out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And straight another, all aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush’d in with equal fear and haste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who star’d about, as pale as death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for a while, as out of breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till having gather’d up his wits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He thus began his tale by fits.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That beastly rabble⁠—that came down<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-193" id="noteref-193" epub:type="noteref">193</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all the garrets⁠—in the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stalls, and shop-boards⁠—in vast swarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With new-chalk’d bills⁠—and rusty arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cry the Cause⁠—up, heretofore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bawl the bishops⁠—out of door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are now drawn up⁠—in greater shoals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To roast⁠—and broil us on the coals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the grandees⁠—of our members</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are carbonading⁠—on the embers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knights, citizens, and burgesses⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held forth by rumps⁠—of pigs and geese,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That serve for characters⁠—and badges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To represent their personages:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each bonfire is a funeral pile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which they roast, and scorch, and broil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ev’ry representative</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have vow’d to roast and broil alive:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ’tis a miracle, we are not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already sacrific’d incarnate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For while we wrangle here, and jar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ are grilly’d all at Temple-Bar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some on the sign-post of an ale-house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang in effigy, on the gallows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made up of rags, to personate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respective officers of state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That henceforth they may stand reputed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proscrib’d in law, and executed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while the work is carrying on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be ready listed under Dun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-194" id="noteref-194" epub:type="noteref">194</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That worthy patriot, once the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tinder-box, of all his fellows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The activ’st member of the five,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as the most primitive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, for his faithful service then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is chosen for a fifth agen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For since the state has made a Quint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Generals, he’s listed in’t.)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This worthy, as the world will say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is paid in specie, his own way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, moulded to the life in clouts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ have pick’d from dunghills hereabouts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’s mounted on a hazel bavin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cropp’d malignant baker gave ’em;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the largest bone-fire riding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ve roasted Cook already and Pride in;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-195" id="noteref-195" epub:type="noteref">195</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>On whom, in equipage and state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His scarecrow fellow-members wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And march in order, two and two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As at thanksgivings th’ us’d to do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each in a tatter’d talisman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like vermin in effigy slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But (what’s more dreadful than the rest)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those rumps are but the tail o’ th’ beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up by Popish engineers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As by the crackers plainly appears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For none but Jesuits have a mission</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To preach the faith with ammunition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And propagate the church with powder:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their founder was a blown-up soldier.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-196" id="noteref-196" epub:type="noteref">196</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>These spiritual pioneers o’ th’ whore’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That have the charge of all her stores,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since first they fail’d in their designs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take in heaven by springing mines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with unanswerable barrels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gunpowder dispute their quarrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now take a course more practicable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By laying trains to fire the rabble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blow us up in th’ open streets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disguis’d in rumps, like Sambenites;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More like to ruin, and confound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the doctrines under ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor have they chosen rumps amiss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For symbols of state mysteries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though some suppose ’twas but to shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How much they scorn’d the saints, the few;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, ’cause they’re wasted to the stumps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are represented best by rumps.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Jesuits have deeper reaches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all their politic far-fetches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the Coptic priest, Kircherus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-197" id="noteref-197" epub:type="noteref">197</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found out this mystic way to jeer us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, as th’ Egyptians us’d by bees<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-198" id="noteref-198" epub:type="noteref">198</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ express their antique Ptolomies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by their stings, the swords they wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held forth authority and power;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because these subtle animals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear all their int’rests in their tails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they’re once impair’d in that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are banish’d their well-order’d state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thought all governments were best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By hieroglyphic rumps exprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, as in bodies natural,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rump’s the fundament of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, in a commonwealth, or realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The government is call’d the helm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which, like vessels under sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re turn’d and winded by the tail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tail, which birds and fishes steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their courses with through sea and air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the rudder of the rump is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The same thing with the stern and compass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This shews how perfectly the rump</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And commonwealth in nature jump.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as a fly, that goes to bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rests with his tail above his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So in this mongrel state of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rabble are the supreme powers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hors’d us on their backs, to show us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A jadish trick at last, and throw us.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The learned rabbins of the Jews</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Write there’s a bone, which they call leuz,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ th’ rump of man, of such a virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No force in nature can do hurt to:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore at the last great day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All th’ other members shall, they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spring out of this, as from a seed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All sorts of vegetals proceed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From whence the learned sons of art</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Os sacrum justly stile that part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then what can better represent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than this rump bone, the Parliament;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, alter several rude ejections,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as prodigious resurrections,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With new reversions of nine lives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts up, and like a cat revives?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now, alas! they’re all expir’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And th’ House, as well as members, fir’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Consum’d in kennels by the rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which they other fires put out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Condemn’d t’ ungoverning distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And paltry private wretchedness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worse than the devil, to privation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all hopes of restoration;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And parted, like the body and soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all dominion and control.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We, who could lately with a look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enact, establish, or revoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose arbitrary nods gave law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And frowns kept multitudes in awe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the bluster of whose huff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All hats, as in a storm, flew off;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ador’d and bowed to by the great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to the footman and valet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had more bent knees than chapel-mats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prayers than the crowns of hats;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall now be scorn’d as wretchedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ruin’s just as low as high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which might be suffer’d, were it all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The horror that attends our fall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some of us have scores more large</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than heads and quarters can discharge;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And others, who, by restless scraping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With public frauds, and private rapine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have mighty heaps of wealth amass’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would gladly lay down all at last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to be but undone, entail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their vessels on perpetual jail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bless the dev’l to let them farms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of forfeit souls on no worse terms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, a near and louder shout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put all th’ assembly to the rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now begun t’ out-run their fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As horses do from whom they bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But crowded on with so much haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until th’ had block’d the passage fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And barricado’d it with haunches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of outward men, and bulks, and paunches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with their shoulders strove to squeeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rather save a crippl’d piece</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all their crush’d and broken members,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than have them grilled on the embers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still pressing on with heavy packs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one another on their backs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vanguard could no longer bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The charges of the forlorn rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, born down headlong by the rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were trampled sorely under foot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet nothing prov’d so formidable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the horrid cookery of the rabble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear, that keeps all feeling out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As lesser pains are by the gout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reliev’d ’em with a fresh supply</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of rallied force enough to fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beat a Tuscan running-horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose jockey-rider is all spurs.</span>
