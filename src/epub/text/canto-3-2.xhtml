						<span>THE learned write, an insect breeze<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-165" id="noteref-165" epub:type="noteref">165</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is but a mungrel prince of bees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That falls before a storm on cows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stings the founders of his house;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whose corrupted flesh that breed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of vermin did at first proceed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So e’re the storm of war broke out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Religion spawn’d a various rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of petulant Capricious sects,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The maggots of corrupted texts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That first run all religion down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after ev’ry swarm its own.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as the Persian Magi once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon their mothers got their sons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-166" id="noteref-166" epub:type="noteref">166</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That were incapable t’ enjoy</span>

						<span>So PRESBYTER begot the other</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the good old Cause, his mother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then bore then like the Devil’s dam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose son and husband are the same.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet no nat’ral tie of blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor int’rest for the common good</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou’d, when their profits interfer’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Get quarter for each other’s beard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when they thriv’d, they never fadg’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But only by the ears engag’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like dogs that snarl about a bone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And play together when they’ve none,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by their truest characters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their constant actions, plainly appears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rebellion now began, for lack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of zeal and plunders to grow slack;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cause and covenant to lessen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Providence to b’ out of season:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now there was no more to purchase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ King’s Revenue, and the Churches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all divided, shar’d, and gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That us’d to urge the Brethren on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which forc’d the stubborn’st for the Cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To cross the cudgels to the laws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That what by breaking them th’ had gain’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By their support might be maintain’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like thieves, that in a hemp-plot lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Secur’d against the hue-and-cry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For PRESBYTER and INDEPENDANT</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>Laid out their apostolic functions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On carnal orders and injunctions;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all their precious Gifts and Graces</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On outlawries and scire facias;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Michael’s term had many a trial,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-167" id="noteref-167" epub:type="noteref">167</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worse than the Dragon and St. Michael,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where thousands fell, in shape of fees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the bottomless abyss.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when like brethren, and like friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They came to share their dividends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ev’ry partner to possess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Church and State Joint-Purchases,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which the ablest Saint, and best,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was nam’d in trust by all the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pay their money; and, instead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ev’ry Brother, pass the deed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strait converted all his gifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pious frauds and holy shifts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And settled all the other shares</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his outward man and’s heirs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held all they claim’d as forfeit lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliver’d up into his hands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pass’d upon his conscience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Pre-intail of Providence;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impeach’d the rest for reprobates,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That had no titles to estates,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But by their spiritual attaints</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Degraded from the right of Saints.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This b’ing reveal’d, they now begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With law and conscience to fall on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And laid about as hot and brain-sick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As th’ Utter Barrister of SWANSWICK;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-168" id="noteref-168" epub:type="noteref">168</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Engag’d with moneybags as bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As men with sand bags did of old;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That brought the lawyers in more fees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all unsanctify’d Trustees;</span>
						<br/>

						<span>I’ th’ case receiv’d the overthrow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or both sides having had the worst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They parted as they met at first.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Poor PRESBYTER was now reduc’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Secluded, and cashier’d, and chous’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn’d out, and excommunicate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all affairs of Church and State;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reform’d t’ a reformado Saint,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And glad to turn itinerant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stroll and teach from town to town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those he had taught up, teach down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make those uses serve agen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the new-enlighten’d men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As fit as when at first they were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reveal’d against the CAVALIER;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Damn ANABAPTIST and FANATIC,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As pat as Popish and Prelatic;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with as little variation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To serve for any Sect i’ th’ nation.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Good Old Cause, which some believe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be the Dev’l that tempted EVE</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Knowledge, and does still invite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The world to mischief with new Light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had store of money in her purse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he took her for bett’r or worse;</span>
						<br/>

					<p>
						<span>The INDEPENDENTS (whose first station</span>

						<span>That serv’d for horse and foot at once;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the saddle of one steed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Saracen and Christian rid;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were free of ev’ry spiritual order,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To preach, and fight, and pray, and murder)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner got the start to lurch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both disciplines, of War and Church</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Providence enough to run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chief commanders of ’em down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But carry’d on the war against</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The common enemy o’ th’ Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a while prevail’d so far,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To win of them the game of war,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And be at liberty once more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ attack themselves, as th’ had before.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For now there was no foe in arms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ unite their factions with alarms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all reduc’d and overcome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Except their worst, themselves at home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wh’ had compass’d all they pray’d, and swore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fought, and preach’d, and plunder’d for;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Subdu’d the Nation, Church, and State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all things, but their laws and hate:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when they came to treat and transact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And share the spoil of all th’ had ransackt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To botch up what th’ had torn and rent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Religion and the Government,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They met no sooner, but prepar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pull down all the war had spar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Agreed in nothing, but t’ abolish,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Subvert, extirpate, and demolish.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For knaves and fools b’ing near of kin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Dutch Boors are t’ a Sooterkin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-169" id="noteref-169" epub:type="noteref">169</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both parties join’d to do their best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To damn the publick interest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And herded only in consults,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To put by one another’s bolts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ out-cant the Babylonian labourers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-170" id="noteref-170" epub:type="noteref">170</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>At all their dialects of jabberers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tug at both ends of the saw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tear down Government and Law.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as two cheats, that play one game,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are both defeated of their aim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So those who play a game of state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And only cavil in debate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although there’s nothing lost or won,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The publick bus’ness is undone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which still the longer ’tis in doing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes the surer way to ruin.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This, when the ROYALISTS perceiv’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Who to their faith as firmly cleav’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And own’d the right they had paid down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So dearly for, the Church and Crown,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ united constanter, and sided</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more, the more their foes divided.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though out-number’d, overthrown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by the fate of war run down)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their duty never was defeated,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor from their oaths and faith retreated;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For loyalty is still the same,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether it win or lose the game;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>True as the dial to the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although it be not shin’d upon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when these brethren in evil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their adversaries, and the Devil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began once more to shew them play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hopes, at least, to have a day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They rally’d in parades of woods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And unfrequented solitudes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conven’d at midnight in out-houses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ appoint new-rising rendezvouzes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a pertinacy unmatch’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For new recruits of danger watch’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner was one blow diverted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But up another party started;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as if nature too, in haste</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To furnish out supplies as fast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before her time, had turn’d destruction</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ a new and numerous production,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner those were overcome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But up rose others in their room,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, like the Christian faith, increast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more, the more they were supprest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom neither chains, nor transportation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proscription, sale, or confiscation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor all the desperate events</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of former try’d experiments</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor wounds cou’d terrify, nor mangling,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To leave off loyalty and dangling;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor death (with all his bones) affright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From vent’ring to maintain the right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From staking life and fortune down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Gainst all together, for the Crown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But kept the title of their cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From forfeiture, like claims in laws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prov’d no prosp’rous usurpation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can ever settle in the nation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until, in spight of force and treason,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They put their loyalty in possession;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by their constancy and faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Destroy ‘d the mighty men of Gath.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Toss’d in a furious hurricane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did OLIVER give up his reign;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-171" id="noteref-171" epub:type="noteref">171</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was believ’d, as well by Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As mortal men and miscreants,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To founder in the Stygian Ferry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he was retriev’d by STERRY,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, in a faise erroneous dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mistook the New Jerusalem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prophanely for the apocryphal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>False Heaven at the end o’ th’ Hall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-172" id="noteref-172" epub:type="noteref">172</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whither it was decreed by Fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His precious reliques to translate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ROMULUS was seen before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B’ as orthodox a Senator;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-173" id="noteref-173" epub:type="noteref">173</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whose divine illumination</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stole the Pagan revelation.</span>
					</p>
					<p>

						<br/>
						<span>Succeeded, though a lame vicegerent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-174" id="noteref-174" epub:type="noteref">174</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who first laid by the Parliament,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only crutch on which he leant;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then sunk underneath the State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rode him above horseman’s weight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now the Saints began their reign,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which th’ had yearn’d so long in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt such bowel-hankerings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see an empire all of Kings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliver’d from the Egyptian awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Justice, Government, and Law,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And free t’ erect what spiritual Cantons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should be reveal’d, or Gospel Hans-Towns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To edify upon the ruins</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of JOHN of LEYDEN’S old Out-goings;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-175" id="noteref-175" epub:type="noteref">175</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who for a weather-cock hung up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Mother Church’s top;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was made a type, by Providence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all their revelations since;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now fulfill’d by his successors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who equally mistook their measures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when they came to shape the model,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not one could fit another’s noddle;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But found their Light and Gifts more wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From fadging than th’ unsanctify’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While ev’ry individual brother</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strove hand to fist against another;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the maddest, and most crackt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were found the busiest to transact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though most hands dispatch apace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make light work, (the proverb says,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet many diff’rent intellects</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are found t’ have contrary effects;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many heads t’ obstruct intrigues,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As slowest insects have most legs.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some were for setting up a King;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all the rest for no such thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless KING JESUS. Others tamper’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For FLEETWOOD, DESBOROUGH, and LAMBERT;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some for the Rump; and some, more crafty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Agitators, and the safety;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some for the Gospel, and massacres</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Spiritual Affidavit-makers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That swore to any human regence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oaths of supremacy and allegiance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yea, though the ablest swearing Saint</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That vouch’d the Bulls o’ th’ Covenant:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Others for pulling down th’ high-places</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Synods and Provincial Classes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That us’d to make such hostile inroads</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Saints, like bloody NIMRODS</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some for fulfilling prophecies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And th’ expiration of th’ excise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some against th’ Egyptian bondage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of holy-days, and paying poundage:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some for the cutting down of groves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rectifying bakers’ loaves:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some for finding out expedients</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the slav’ry of obedience.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some were for Gospel Ministers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some for Red-coat Seculars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As men most fit t’ hold forth the word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wield the one and th’ other sword.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some were for carrying on the work</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the Pope, and some the Turk;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some for engaging to suppress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Camisado of surplices,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gifts and dispensations hinder’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn’d to th’ Outward Man the Inward;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More proper for the cloudy night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Popery than Gospel Light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Others were for abolishing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That tool of matrimony, a ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which th’ unsanctify’d bridegroom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is marry’d only to a thumb;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As wise as ringing of a pig,</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>The bride to nothing but her will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nulls the after-marriage still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some were for th’ utter extirpation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of linsey-woolsey in the nation;</span>
						<br/>

						<span>‘Mong these there was a politician<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-176" id="noteref-176" epub:type="noteref">176</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>With more heads than a beast in vision,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more intrigues in ev’ry one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all the whores of Babylon:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So politic, as if one eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the other were a spy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, to trepan the one to think</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other blind, both strove to blink;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in his dark pragmatick way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As busy as a child at play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H’ had seen three Governments run down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had a hand in ev’ry one;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was for ’em and against ’em all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But barb’rous when they came to fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, by trepanning th’ old to ruin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He made his int’rest with the new one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Play’d true and faithful, though against</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His conscience, and was still advanc’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For by the witchcraft of rebellion</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transform’d t’ a feeble state-camelion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By giving aim from side to side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He never fail’d to save his tide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But got the start of ev’ry state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at a change ne’er came too late;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou’d turn his word, and oath, and faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As many ways as in a lath;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By turning, wriggle, like a screw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Int’ highest trust, and out, for new.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when h’ had happily incurr’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instead of hemp, to be preferr’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pass’d upon a government,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He pay’d his trick, and out he went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, being out, and out of hopes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mount his ladder (more) of ropes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wou’d strive to raise himself upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The publick ruin, and his own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So little did he understand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The desp’rate feats he took in hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when h’ had got himself a name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fraud and tricks, he spoil’d his game;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had forc’d his neck into a noose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shew his play at fast and loose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he chanc’d t’ escape, mistook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For art and subtlety, his luck.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So right his judgment was cut fit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made a tally to his wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And both together most profound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At deeds of darkness under-ground;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As th’ earth is easiest undermin’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By vermin impotent and blind.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>By all these arts, and many more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H’ had practis’d long and much before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our state artificer foresaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which way the world began to draw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as old sinners have all points</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ compass in their bones and joints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can by their pangs and aches find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All turns and changes of the wind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And better than by NAPIER’s bones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-177" id="noteref-177" epub:type="noteref">177</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Feel in their own the age of moons;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So guilty sinners in a state</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can by their crimes prognosticate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in their consciences feel pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some days before a show’r of rain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He therefore wisely cast about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All ways he cou’d, t’ ensure his throat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hither came, t’ observe and smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What courses other riskers took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the utmost do his best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To save himself, and hang the rest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To match this Saint, there was another<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-178" id="noteref-178" epub:type="noteref">178</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As busy and perverse a Brother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An haberdasher of small wares</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In politicks and state affairs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More Jew than Rabbi ACHITOPHEL,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And better gifted to rebel:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when h’ had taught his tribe to ‘spouse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cause, aloft, upon one house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scorn’d to set his own in order,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But try’d another, and went further;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So suddenly addicted still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To’s only principle, his will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That whatsoe’er it chanc’d to prove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor force of argument cou’d move;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor law, nor cavalcade of Holborn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could render half a grain less stubborn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he at any time would hang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For th’ opportunity t’ harangue;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rather on a gibbet dangle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than miss his dear delight, to wrangle;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which his parts were so accomplisht,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, right or wrong, he ne’er was non-plusht;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still his tongue ran on, the less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of weight it bore, with greater ease;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with its everlasting clack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set all men’s ears upon the rack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner cou’d a hint appear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But up he started to picqueer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made the stoutest yield to mercy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he engag’d in controversy.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not by the force of carnal reason,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But indefatigable teazing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With vollies of eternal babble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And clamour, more unanswerable.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though his topics, frail and weak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou’d ne’er amount above a freak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He still maintain’d ’em, like his faults,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the desp’ratest assaults;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And back’d their feeble lack of sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With greater heat and confidence?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As bones of Hectors, when they differ,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more they’re cudgel’d grow the stiffer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet when his profit moderated,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fury of his heat abated.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For nothing but his interest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou’d lay his Devil of Contest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was his choice, or chance; or curse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ espouse the Cause for bett’r or worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with his worldly goods and wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And soul and body, worship’d it:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when he found the sullen trapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Possess’d with th’ Devil, worms, and claps;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Trojan mare, in foal with Greeks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-179" id="noteref-179" epub:type="noteref">179</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not half so full of jadish tricks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though squeamish in her outward woman,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As loose and rampant as Dol Common;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He still resolv’d to mend the matter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ adhere and cleave the obstinater;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the skittisher and looser</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her freaks appear’d, to sit the closer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fools are stubborn in their way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As coins are harden’d by th’ allay:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And obstinacy’s ne’er so stiff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when ’tis in a wrong belief.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These two, with others, being met,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And close in consultation set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After a discontented pause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not without sufficient cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The orator we nam’d of late,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less troubled with the pangs of State</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than with his own impatience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To give himself first audience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After he had a while look’d wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At last broke silence, and the ice.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, There’s nothing makes me doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our last out-goings brought about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More than to see the characters</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of real jealousies and fears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not feign’d, as once, but, sadly horrid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scor’d upon ev’ry Member’s forehead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, ‘cause the clouds are drawn together,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And threaten sudden change of weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Feel pangs and aches of state-turns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And revolutions in their corns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, since our workings-out are cross’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throw up the Cause before ’tis lost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was it to run away we meant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, taking of the Covenant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lamest cripples of the brothers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took oaths to run before all others;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in their own sense only swore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To strive to run away before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now would prove, that words and oath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Engage us to renounce them both?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis true, the Cause is in the lurch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between a Right and Mungrel-Church;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Presbyter and Independent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stickle which shall make an end on’t;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twas made out to us the last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Expedient⁠—(I mean Marg’ret’s Fast,)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-180" id="noteref-180" epub:type="noteref">180</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Providence had been suborn’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What answer was to be return’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Else why should tumults fright us now,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We have so many times come through?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And understand as well to tame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when they serve our turns t’inflame:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have prov’d how inconsiderable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are all engagements of the rabble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose frenzies must be reconcil’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With drums and rattles, like a child;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But never prov’d so prosperous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when they were led on by us</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all our scourging of religion</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began with tumult and sedition;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When hurricanes of fierce commotion</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became strong motives to devotion;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As carnal seamen, in a storm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn pious converts, and reform;)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When rusty weapons, with chalk’d edges,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Maintain’d our feeble privileges;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brown-bills levy’d in the City,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made bills to pass the Grand Committee;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When zeal, with aged clubs and gleaves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave chace to rochets and white sleeves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made the Church, and State, and Laws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Submit t’ old iron and the Cause.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as we thriv’d by tumults then,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So might we better now agen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we knew how, as then we did,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To use them rightly in our need:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tumults, by which the mutinous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betray themselves instead of us.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hollow-hearted, disaffected,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And close malignant are detected,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who lay their lives and fortunes down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For pledges to secure our own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And freely sacrifice their ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ appease our jealousies and fears;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, for all these providences</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W’ are offer’d, if we had our senses;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We idly sit like stupid blockheads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our hands committed to our pockets;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nothing but our tongues at large,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To get the wretches a discharge:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like men condemn’d to thunder-bolts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, ere the blow, become mere dolts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or fools besotted with their crimes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That know not how to shift betimes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And neither have the hearts to stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor wit enough to run away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, if we cou’d resolve on either,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might stand or fall at least together;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No mean or trivial solace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To partners in extreme distress;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who us’d to lessen their despairs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By parting them int’ equal shares;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if the more they were to bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They felt the weight the easier;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ev’ry one the gentler hung,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more he took his turn among.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ’tis not come to that, as yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we had courage left, or wit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, when our fate can be no worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are fitted for the bravest course;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have time to rally, and prepare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our last and best defence, despair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despair, by which the gallant’st feats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have been atchiev’d in greatest straits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horrid’st danger safely wav’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By being courageously out-brav’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wounds by wider wounds are heal’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And poisons by themselves expell’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so they might be now agen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we were, what we shou’d be, men;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not so dully desperate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To side against ourselves with Fate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As criminals, condemn’d to suffer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are blinded first, and then turn’d over.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This comes of breaking Covenants,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And setting up Exauns of Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fine, like aldermen, for grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be excus’d the efficace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Spiritual men are too transcendent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mount their banks for Independent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hang like MAHOMET in th’ air,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-181" id="noteref-181" epub:type="noteref">181</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or St. IGNATIUS at his prayer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By pure geometry, and hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dependence upon Church or State;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disdain the pedantry o’ th’ letter;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And since obedience is better</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(The Scripture says) than sacrifice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Presume the less on’t will suffice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scorn to have the moderat’st stints</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prescrib’d their peremptory hints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or any opinion, true or false,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Declar’d as such, in doctrinals</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But left at large to make their best on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without b’ing call’d t’ account or question,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Interpret all the spleen reveals;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As WHITTINGTON explain’d the bells;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bid themselves turn back agen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lord May’rs of New Jerusalem;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But look so big and over-grown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They scorn their edifiers t’ own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who taught them all their sprinkling lessons,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their tones, and sanctified expressions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bestow’d their Gifts upon a Saint,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Charity on those that want;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And learn’d th’ apocryphal bigots</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ inspire themselves with short-hand notes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which they scorn and hate them worse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than dogs and cats do sow-gelders.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who first bred them up to pray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And teach, the House of Commons Way?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where had they all their gifted phrases,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But from our CALAMYS and CASES?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without whose sprinkling and sowing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who e’er had heard of NYE or OWEN?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their dispensations had been stifled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for our ADONIRAM BYFIELD;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had they not begun the war,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ had ne’er been sainted, as they are:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Saints in peace degenerate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dwindle down to reprobate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their zeal corrupts, like standing water,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In th’ intervals of war and slaughter;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abates the sharpness of its edge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the power of sacrilege.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though they’ve tricks to cast their sins</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As easy as serpents do their skins,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-182" id="noteref-182" epub:type="noteref">182</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in a while grow out agen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In peace they turn mere carnal men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the most refin’d of saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As naturally grow miscreants,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>For their conforming to the wicked;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With whom the greatest difference</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lies more in words, and shew, than sense.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as the Pope, that keeps the gate</span>

						<span>Of Heaven, wears three crowns of state;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So he that keeps the gate of Hell,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Their spiritual gizzards are too warm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which puts the over-heated sots</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Divert their rage upon themselves.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the war is not between</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Brethren and the Men of Sin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Saint and Saint, to spill the blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one another’s brotherhood;</span>

						<span>’Twill ne’er amount to persecution.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall precious Saints, and secret ones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Break one another’s outward bones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eat the flesh of Brethren,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instead of Kings and mighty men?</span>

						<br/>
						<span>When common danger threatens both?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall mastiffs, by the coller pull’d,</span>

						<span>Engag’d with bulls, let go their hold,</span>

						<span>Their animosities a while;</span>

						<span>Without the danger of surprize</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By both our common enemies?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This none but we alone cou’d doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who understand their workings out;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Giv’n up t’ as reprobate a nonsense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As spiritual out-laws, whom the pow’r</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of miracle can ne’er restore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We, whom at first they set up under,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In revelation only of plunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who since have had so many trials</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their encroaching self-denials,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rook’d upon us with design</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To out-reform, and undermine;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took all our interest and commands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perfidiously out of our hands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Involv’d us in the guilt of blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the motive gains allow’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made us serve as ministerial,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like younger Sons of Father BELIAL;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, for all th’ inhuman wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ had done us and the Cause so long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We never fail to carry on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The work still as we had begun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But true and faithfully obey’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And neither preach’d them hurt, nor pray’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor troubled them to crop our ears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor hang us like the cavaliers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor put them to the charge of gaols,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find us pill’ries and cart’s-tails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or hangman’s wages, which the State</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was forc’d (before them) to be at,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cut, like tallies, to the stumps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our ears for keeping true accompts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And burnt our vessels, like a new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seal’d peck, or bushel, for b’ing true;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But hand in hand, like faithful brothers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held for the Cause against all others,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disdaining equally to yield</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One syllable of what we held,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though we differ’d now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘Bout outward things, and outward men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our inward men, and constant frame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of spirit, still were near the same;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And till they first began to cant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sprinkle down the Covenant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We ne’er had call in any place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor dream’d of teaching down free grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But join’d our gifts perpetually</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the common enemy.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although ’twas ours and their opinion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each other’s Church was but a RIMMON;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, for all this gospel-union,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And outward shew of Church-communion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll ne’er admit us to our shares</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ruling Church or State affairs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor give us leave t’ absolve, or sentence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ our own conditions of repentance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But shar’d our dividend o’ th’ Crown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We had so painfully preach’d down;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forc’d us, though against the grain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ have calls to teach it up again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas but justice to restore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wrongs we had receiv’d before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when ’twas held forth in our way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W’ had been ungrateful not to pay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, for the right w’ have done the nation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have earn’d our temporal salvation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And put our vessels in a way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more to come again in play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if the turning of us out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has brought this Providence about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that our only suffering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is able to bring in the King,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What would our actions not have done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had we been suffer’d to go on?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore may pretend t’ a share,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At least; in carrying on th’ affair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whether that be so, or not,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W’ have done enough to have it thought;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that’s as good as if w’ had done’t,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And easier pass’t upon account:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if it be but half deny’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis half as good as justifi’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The world is nat’rally averse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all the truth it sees or hears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But swallows nonsense, and a lie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With greediness and gluttony</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though it have the pique, and long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis still for something in the wrong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As women long, when they’re with child,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For things extravagant and wild;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For meats ridiculous and fulsome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But seldom any thing that’s wholesome;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like the world, men’s jobbernoles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn round upon their ears, the poles;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what they’re confidently told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By no sense else can be control’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this, perhaps, may prove time means</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more to hedge-in Providence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as relapses make diseases</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More desp’rate than their first accesses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we but get again in pow’r,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our work is easier than before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we more ready and expert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ th’ mystery to do our part.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We, who did rather undertake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The first war to create than make,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when of nothing ’twas begun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rais’d funds as strange to carry ‘t on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trepann’d the State, and fac’d it down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With plots and projects of our own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if we did such feats at first,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What can we now we’re better vers’d?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have a freer latitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than sinners give themselves, allow’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore likeliest to bring in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On fairest terms, our discipline;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which it was reveal’d long since,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We were ordain’d by Providence;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When three Saints Ears, our predecessors,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-186" id="noteref-186" epub:type="noteref">186</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cause’s primitive Confessors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B’ing crucify’d, the nation stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In just so many years of blood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, multiply’d by six, exprest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The perfect number of the beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prov’d that we must be the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring this work about agen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those who laid the first foundation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compleat the thorough Reformation:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who have gifts to carry on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So great a work, but we alone?</span>

						<span>What churches have such able pastors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And precious, powerful, preaching masters?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Possess’d with absolute dominions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’er brethren’s purses and opinions?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trusted with the double keys</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heaven and their warehouses;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, when the Cause is in distress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can furnish out what sums they please,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That brooding lie in bankers’ hands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be dispos’d at their commands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And daily increase and multiply,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With doctrine, use, and usury:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can fetch in parties (as in war</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All other heads of cattle are)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From th’ enemy of all religions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as high and low conditions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And share them, from blue ribbands, down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all blue aprons in the town;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From ladies hurried in calleches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With cor’nets at their footmens’ breeches,</span>

						<span>To bawds as fat as Mother Nab;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All guts and belly, like a crab.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our party’s great, and better ty’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With oaths and trade than any side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has one considerable improvement,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To double fortify the Cov’nant:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I mean our Covenant to purchase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Delinquents titles, and the Churches;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pass in sale, from hand to hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among ourselves, for current land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rise or fall, like Indian actions,</span>

						<span>According to the rate of factions</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our best reserve for Reformation,</span>

						<span>When new out-goings give occasion;</span>

						<span>The Covenant (their creed) t’ assert;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>To serve for members, to our ends,</span>

						<span>With smart remarks of leering faces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And annotations of grimaces.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After h’ had administer’d a dose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of snuff-mundungus to his nose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And powder’d th’ inside of his skull,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instead of th’ outward jobbernol,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shook it with a scornful look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On th’ adversary, and thus he spoke:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In dressing a calves head, although</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tongue and brains together go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both keep so great a distance here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis strange if ever they come near;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who did ever play his gambols</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With such insufferable rambles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the bringing in the KING,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And keeping of him out, one thing?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which none could do, but those that swore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ as point-plank nonsense heretofore:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to defend, was to invade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to assassinate, to aid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless, because you drove him out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(And that was never made a doubt,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No pow’r is able to restore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bring him in, but on your score</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spiritual doctrine, that conduces</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Most properly to all your uses.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis true, a scorpions oil is said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To cure the wounds the vermine made;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And weapons, drest with salves, restore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heal the hurts they gave before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whether Presbyterians have</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much good nature as the salve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or virtue in them as the vermine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those who have try’d them can determine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Indeed, ‘th pity you should miss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ arrears of all your services,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for th’ eternal obligation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Y’ have laid upon th’ ungrateful nation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be us’d so unconscionably hard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As not to find a just reward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For letting rapine loose, and murther,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rage just so far, but no further;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And setting all the land on fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To burn’t to a scantling, but no higher;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For vent’ring to assassinate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cut the throats, of Church and State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not be allow’d the fittest men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take the charge of both agen:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Especially, that have the grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of self-denying, gifted face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who when your projects have miscarry’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can lay them, with undaunted forehead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On those you painfully trepann’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sprinkled in at second hand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As we have been, to share the guilt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Christian Blood, devoutly spilt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For so our ignorance was flamm’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To damn ourselves, t’ avoid being damn’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till finding your old foe, the hangman,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like to lurch you at back-gammon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And win your necks upon the set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as ours, who did but bet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For he had drawn your ears before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nick’d them on the self-same score,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We threw the box and dice away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before y’ had lost us, at foul play;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brought you down to rook, and lie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fancy only, on the by;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Redeem’d your forfeit jobbernoles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From perching upon lofty poles;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rescu’d all your outward traitors</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From hanging up like aligators;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which ingeniously y’ have shew’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your Presbyterian gratitude:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would freely have paid us home in kind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not have been one rope behind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those were your motives to divide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scruple, on the other side.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To turn your zealous frauds, and force,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fits of conscience and remorse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be convinc’d they were in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And face about for new again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For truth no more unveil’d your eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than maggots are convinc’d to flies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore all your lights and calls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are but apocryphal and false,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To charge us with the consequences</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your native insolences,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to your own imperious wills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laid Law and Gospel neck and heels;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Corrupted the Old Testament,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To serve the New for precedent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ amend its errors, and defects,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With murther, and rebellion texts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which there is not any one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the Book to sow upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore (from your tribe) the Jews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held Christian doctrine forth, and use;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Mahomet (your chief) began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mix them in the Alchoran:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Denounc’d and pray’d, with fierce devotion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bended elbows on the cushion;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stole from the beggars all your tones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gifted mortifying groans;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had Lights where better eyes were blind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As pigs are said to see the wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fill’d Bedlam with predestination,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Knights-bridge with illumination:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made children, with your tones, to run for’t,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As bad as bloody-bones, or LUNSFORD:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While women, great with child, miscarry’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For being to malignants marry’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transform’d all wives to DALILAHS</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose husbands were not for the Cause;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn’d the men to ten horn’d cattle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because they came not out to battle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made taylors’ prentices turn heroes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fear of being transform’d to MEROZ:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rather forfeit their indentures,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than not espouse the Saints’ adventures.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could transubstantiate, metamorphose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And charm whole herds of beasts, like Orpheus;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inchant the King’s and Churches lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ obey and follow your commands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And settle on a new freehold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As MARCLY-HILL had done of old:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could turn the Covenant, and translate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gospel into spoons and plate:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Expound upon all merchants’ cashes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And open th’ intricatest places</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could catechize a money-box,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prove all powches orthodox;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the Cause became a DAMON,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And PYTHIAS the wicked Mammon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And yet, in spight of all your charms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To conjure legion up in arms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And raise more devils in the rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than e’er y’ were able to cast out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Y’ have been reduc’d, and by those fools</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bred up (you say) in your own schools;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, though but gifted at your feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have made it plain, they have more wit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By whom y’ have been so oft trepann’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held forth out of all command,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-gifted, out-impuls’d, out-done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out-reveal’d at carryings-on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your dispensations worm’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-Providenc’d, and out-reform’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ejected out of Church and State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all things, but the peoples’ hate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spirited out of th’ enjoyments</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of precious, edifying employments,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By those who lodg’d their Gifts and Graces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like better bowlers, in your places;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All which you bore with resolution,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Charg’d on th’ accompt of persecution;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though most righteously opprest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against your wills, still acquiesc’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never hum’d and hah’d sedition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor snuffled treason, nor misprision.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is, because you never durst;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For had you preach’d and pray’d your worst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alas! you were no longer able</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To raise your posse of the rabble:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One single red-coat centinel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-charm’d the magick of the spell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, with his squirt-fire, could disperse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whole troops with chapter rais’d and verse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We knew too well those tricks of yours,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To leave it ever in your powers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or trust our safeties, or undoings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To your disposing of out-goings;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or to your ordering Providence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One farthing’s-worth of consequence.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For had you pow’r to undermine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or wit to carry a design,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or correspondence to trepan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inveigle, or betray one man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There’s nothing else that intervenes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bars your zeal to use the means</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore wond’rous like, no doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring in Kings, or keep them out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brave undertakers to restore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cou’d not keep yourselves in pow’r;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ advance the int’rests of the Crown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wanted wit to keep your own.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Tis true, you have (for I’d be loth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wrong ye) done your parts in both,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep him out, and bring him in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As grace is introduc’d by sin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas your zealous want of sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sanctify’d impertinence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your carrying business in a huddle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That forc’d our rulers to new-model;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oblig’d the State to tack about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn you, root and branch, all out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reformado, one and all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ your great Croysado General.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-189" id="noteref-189" epub:type="noteref">189</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your greedy slav’ring to devour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before ’twas in your clutches, pow’r,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sprung the game you were to set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before y’ had time to draw the net;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your spight to see the Churches’ lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Divided into other hands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all your sacrilegious ventures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laid out in tickets and debentures;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your envy to he sprinkled down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Under-Churches in the town;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no course us’d to stop their mouths,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor th’ Independents’ spreading growths</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All which consider’d, ’tis most true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None bring him in so much as you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have prevail’d beyond their plots,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their midnight juntos, and seal’d knots</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thrive more by your zealous piques,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all their own rash politicks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you this way may claim a share</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In carrying (as you brag) th’ affair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Else frogs and toads, that croak’d the Jews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From PHARAOH and his brick-kilns loose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flies and mange, that set them free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From task-masters and slavery,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were likelier to do the feat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In any indiff’rent man’s conceit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who e’er heard of restoration</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until your thorough Reformation?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is, the King’s and Churches’ land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were sequester’d int’ other hands:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For only then, and not before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your eyes were open’d to restore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the work was carrying on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who cross’d it, but yourselves alone?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by a world of hints appears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All plain and extant as your ears.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But first, o’ th’ first: The Isle of WIGHT</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will rise up, if you should deny’t;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where HENDERSON, and th’ other masses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were sent to cap texts, and put cases;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pass for deep and learned scholars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although but paltry Ob and Sollers:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-190" id="noteref-190" epub:type="noteref">190</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if th’ unseasonable fools</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had been a coursing in the schools;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until th’ had prov’d the Devil author</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ Covenant, and the Cause his daughter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when they charg’d him with the guilt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the blood that had been spilt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They did not mean he wrought th’ effusion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In person, like Sir PRIDE, or HUGHSON,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-191" id="noteref-191" epub:type="noteref">191</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But only those who first begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The quarrel were by him set on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who could those be but the Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those Reformation Termagants?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But e’er this pass’d, the wise debate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spent so much time, it grew too late;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For OLIVER had gotten ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ inclose him with his warriors round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had brought his Providence about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn’d th’ untimely sophists out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor had the UXBRIDGE bus’ness less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of nonsense in’t, or sottishness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When from a scoundrel Holder-forth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scum as well as son o’ th’ earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your mighty Senators took law;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At his command, were forc’d t’ withdraw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sacrifice the peace o’ th’ nation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To doctrine, use and application.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So when the SCOTS, your constant cronies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ espousers of your Cause and monies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who had so often, in your aid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many ways been soundly paid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came in at last for better ends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To prove themselves your trusty friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You basely left them, and the Church</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They train’d you up to, in the lurch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suffer’d your own tribe of Christians</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fall before, as true Philistines.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This shews what utensils y’ have been,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring the King’s concernments in;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which is so far from being true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That none but he can bring in you:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if he take you into trust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will find you most exactly just:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as will punctually repay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With double interest, and betray.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not that I think those pantomimes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who vary action with the times,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are less ingenious in their art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than those who dully act one part;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or those who turn from side to side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More guilty than the wind and tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All countries are a wise man’s home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so are governments to some,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who change them for the same intrigues</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That statesmen use in breaking leagues;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While others, in old faiths and troths,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look odd as out-of-fashion’d cloths;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nastier in an old opinion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than those who never shift their linnen.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For true and faithful’s sure to lose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which way soever the game goes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whether parties lose or win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is always nick’d, or else hedg’d in:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While pow’r usurp’d, like stol’n delight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is more bewitching than the right;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the times begin to alter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None rise so high as from the halter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so may we, if w’ have but sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To use the necessary means;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not your usual stratagems</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On one another, Lights and Dreams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stand on terms as positive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if we did not take, but give:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set up the Covenant on crutches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Gainst those who have us in their clutches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dream of pulling churches down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before w’ are sure to prop our own:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your constant method of proceeding,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the carnal mans of heeding;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who ’twixt your inward sense and outward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are worse, than if y’ had none, accoutred.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I grant, all courses are in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless we can get in again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only way that’s left us now;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all the difficulty’s, How?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis true, w’ have money, th’ only pow ‘r</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all mankind falls down before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Money, that, like the swords of kings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is the last reason of all things;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore need not doubt our play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has all advantages that way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As long as men have faith to sell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And meet with those that can pay well;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose half-starv’d pride, and avarice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One Church and State will not suffice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ expose to sale, beside the wages</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of storing plagues to after-ages.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor is our money less our own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ’twas before we laid it down;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twill return, and turn t’ account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we are brought, in play upon’t:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or but, by casting knaves, get in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What pow ‘r can hinder us to win?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We know the arts we us’d before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In peace and war, and something more;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by th’ unfortunate events,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can mend our next experiments:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when w’ are taken into trust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How easy are the wisest choust?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who see but th’ outsides of our feats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not their secret springs and weights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while they’re busy at their ease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can carry what designs we please.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How easy is it to serve for agents,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To prosecute our old engagements?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep the Good Old Cause on foot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And present power from taking root?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inflame them both with false alarms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of plots and parties taking arms;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep the Nation’s wounds too wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From healing up of side to side;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Profess the passionat’st concerns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For both their interests by turns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only way to improve our own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By dealing faithfully with none;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As bowls run true, by being made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On purpose false, and to be sway’d:)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if we should be true to either,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould turn us out of both together;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore have no other means</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stand upon our own defence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But keeping up our ancient party</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vigour, confident and hearty:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reconcile our late dissenters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our brethren, though by other venters;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unite them, and their different maggots,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As long and short sticks are in faggots,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make them join again as close</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when they first began t’ espouse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Erect them into separate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New Jewish tribes, in Church and State;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To join in marriage and commerce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And only among themselves converse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that are not of their mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make enemies to all mankind:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Take all religions in and stickle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Conclave down to Conventicle;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Agreeing still, or disagreeing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>According to the Light in being.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sometimes for liberty of conscience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spiritual mis-rule, in one sense;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in another quite contrary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As dispensations chance to vary;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stand for, as the times will bear it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All contradictions of the Spirit:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Protect their emissaries, empower’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To preach sedition and the word;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they’re hamper’d by the laws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Release the lab’rers for the Cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn the persecution back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On those that made the first attack;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep them equally in awe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From breaking or maintaining law:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they have their fits too soon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the full-tides of the moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put off their zeal t’ a fitter season</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For sowing faction in and treason;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And keep them hooded, and their Churches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like hawks from baiting on their perches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, when the blessed time shall come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of quitting BABYLON and ROME,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They may be ready to restore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their own Fifth Monarchy once more.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile be better arm’d to fence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against revolts of Providence.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By watching narrowly, and snapping</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All blind sides of it, they happen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if success could make us Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or ruin turn’d us miscreants:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A scandal that wou’d fall too hard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a few, and. unprepar’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>These are the courses we must run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spight of our hearts, or be undone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not to stand on terms and freaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before we have secur’d our necks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But do our work, as out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As stars by day, and suns by night;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All licence of the people own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In opposition to the Crown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the Crown as fiercely side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The head and body to divide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The end of all we first design’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that yet remains behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be sure to spare no publick rapine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On all emergencies, that happen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’tis as easy to supplant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Authority as men in want;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As some of us, in trusts, have made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The one hand with the other trade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gain’d vastly by their joint endeavour;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The right a thief; the left receiver;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what the one, by tricks, forestall’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other, by as sly, retail’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For gain has wonderful effects</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ improve the Factory of Sects;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rule of faith in all professions.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And great DIANA of the EPHESIANS;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence turning of Religion’s made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The means to turn and wind a trade:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though some change it for the worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They put themselves into a course;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And draw in store of customers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To thrive the better in commerce:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all Religions flock together,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like tame and wild fowl of a feather;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To nab the itches of their sects,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As jades do one another’s necks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hence ’tis, Hypocrisy as well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will serve t’ improve a Church as ZEAL:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Persecution or Promotion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do equally advance Devotion.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Let business, like ill watches, go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sometime too fast, sometime too slow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For things in order are put out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So easy, Ease itself will do’t;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the feat’s design’d and meant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What miracle can bar th’ event?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’tis more easy to betray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ruin any other way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All possible occasions start</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The weighty’st matters to divert;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obstruct, perplex, distract, intangle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lay perpetual trains to wrangle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in affairs of less import,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That neither do us good nor hurt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they receive as little by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-fawn as much, and out-comply;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seem as scrupulously just,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bait our hooks for greater trust;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still be careful to cry down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All publick actions, though our own:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The least miscarriage aggravate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And charge it all upon the Sate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Express the horrid’st detestation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pity the distracted nation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tell stories scandalous and false,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ th’ proper language of cabals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where all a subtle statesman says,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is half in words, and half in face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As Spaniards talk in dialogues</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of heads and shoulders, nods and shrugs:)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Entrust it under solemn vows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mum, and silence, and the rose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be retail’d again in whispers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For th’ easy credulous to disperse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus far the Statesman⁠—When a shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard at a distance, put him out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And straight another, all aghast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rush’d in with equal fear and haste;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who star’d about, as pale as death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for a while, as out of breath;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till having gather’d up his wits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thus began his tale by fits.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That beastly rabble⁠—that came down<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-192" id="noteref-192" epub:type="noteref">192</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all the garrets⁠—in the town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stalls, and shop-boards⁠—in vast swarms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With new-chalk’d bills⁠—and rusty arms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To cry the Cause⁠—up, heretofore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bawl the BISHOPS⁠—out of door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are now drawn up⁠—in greater shoals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To roast⁠—and broil us on the coals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the Grandees⁠—of our Members</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are carbonading⁠—on the embers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held forth by Rumps⁠—of Pigs and Geese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That serve for Characters⁠—and Badges.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To represent their Personages:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each bonfire is a funeral pile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which they roast, and scorch, and broil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ev’ry representative</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have vow’d to roast⁠—and broil alive:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And ’tis a miracle, we are not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already sacrific’ d incarnate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For while we wrangle here, and jar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W’ are grilly’d all at TEMPLE-BAR:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some on the sign-post of an ale-house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hang in effigy, on the gallows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made up of rags, to personate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Respective Officers of State;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That henceforth they may stand reputed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proscrib’d in law, and executed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while the Work is carrying on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be ready listed under DON,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-193" id="noteref-193" epub:type="noteref">193</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That worthy patriot, once the bellows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tinder-box, of all his fellows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The activ’st Member of the Five,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as the most primitive;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, for his faithful service then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is chosen for a Fifth agen:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For since the State has made a Quint</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Generals, he’s listed in’t.)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This worthy, as the world will say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is paid in specie, his own way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, moulded to the life in clouts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ have pick’d from dung-hills hereabouts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’s mounted on a hazel bavin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cropp’d malignant baker gave ‘m;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the largest bone-fire riding,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ve roasted COOK already and PRIDE in;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-194" id="noteref-194" epub:type="noteref">194</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>On whom in equipage and state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His scarecrow fellow-members wait,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And march in order, two and two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As at thanksgivings th’ us’d to do;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each in a tatter’d talisman,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like vermin in effigie slain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But (what’s more dreadful than the rest)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those Rumps are but the tail o’ th’ Beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set up by Popish engineers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by the crackers plainly appears;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For none but Jesuits have a mission</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To preach the faith with ammunition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And propagate the Church with powder:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their founder was a blown-up Soldier.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-195" id="noteref-195" epub:type="noteref">195</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>These spiritual pioneers o’ th’ Whore’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That have the charge of all her stores,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since first they fail’d in their designs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take in Heav’n by springing mines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with unanswerable barrels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gunpowder dispute their quarrels,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now take a course more practicable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By laying trains to fire the rabble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blow us up in th’ open streets,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disguis’d in Rumps, like Sambenites;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More like to ruin, and confound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all the doctrines under ground.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nor have they chosen Rumps amiss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For symbols of State-mysteries;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though some suppose ’twas but to shew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How much they scorn’d the Saints, the few;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, ‘cause they’re wasted to the stumps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are represented best by Rumps.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Jesuits have deeper reaches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all their politick far-fetches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the Coptick Priest, Kircherus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-196" id="noteref-196" epub:type="noteref">196</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found out this mystick way to jeer us.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, as th’ Egyptians us’d by bees<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-197" id="noteref-197" epub:type="noteref">197</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ express their antick PTOLOMIES;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by their stings, the swords they wore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held forth authority and power;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because these subtil animals</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bear all their int’rests in their tails;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they’re once impar’d in that,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are banish’d their well-order’d state;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They thought all governments were best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Hieroglyphick Rumps exprest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For, as in bodies natural,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rump’s the fundament of all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, in a commonwealth, or realm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The government is call’d the helm;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which, like vessels under sail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’re turn’d and winded by the tail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tail, which birds and fishes steer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their courses with through sea and air;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whom the rudder of the rump is</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same thing with the stern and compass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This shews how perfectly the Rump</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Commonwealth in nature jump.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as a fly, that goes to bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rests with his tail above his head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So in this mungrel state of ours;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rabble are the supreme powers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That hors’d us on their backs, to show us</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A jadish trick at last, and throw us.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The learned Rabbins of the Jews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Write there’s a bone, which they call leuz,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ th’ rump of man, of such a virtue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No force in nature can do hurt to;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore at the last great day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All th’ other members shall, they say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spring out of this, as from a seed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All sorts of vegetals proceed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whence the learned sons of art</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Os Sacrum justly stile that part.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then what can better represent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than this Rump Bone the Parliament;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, alter several rude ejections,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as prodigious resurrections,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With new reversions of nine lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Starts up, and like a cat revives?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But now, alas! they’re all expir’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And th’ House, as well as Members, fir’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consum’d in kennels by the rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which they other fires put out:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condemn’d t’ ungoverning distress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And paultry, private wretchedness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worse than the Devil, to privation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond all hopes of restoration;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And parted, like the body and soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all dominion and controul.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We, who cou’d lately with a look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enact, establish, or revoke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose arbitrary nods gave law,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And frowns kept multitudes in awe;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the bluster of whose huff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All hats, as in a storm, flew off;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ador’d and bowed to by the great,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down to the footman and valet;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had more bent knees than chapel-mats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prayers than the crowns of hats;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall now be scorn’d as wretchedly;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ruin’s just as low as high;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which might be suffer’d, were it all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horror that attends our fall:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For some of us have scores more large</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than heads and quarters can discharge;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And others, who, by restless scraping,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With publick frauds, and private rapine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have mighty heaps of wealth amass’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would gladly lay down all at last;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to be but undone, entail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their vessels on perpetual jail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bless the Dev’l to let them farms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of forfeit souls on no worse terms.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This said, a near and louder shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put all th’ assembly to the rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who now begun t’ out-run their fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As horses do from whom they bear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But crowded on with so mach haste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until th’ had block’d the passage fast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And barricado’d it with haunches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of outward men, and bulks, and paunches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with their shoulders strove to squeeze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rather save a crippled piece</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all their crush’d and broken members,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than have them grilled on the embers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still pressing on with heavy packs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one another on their backs:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The van-guard could no longer hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The charges of the forlorn rear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, born down headlong by the rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were trampled sorely under foot:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet nothing prov’d so formidable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As the horrid cookery of the rabble;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fear, that keeps all feeling out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As lesser pains are by the gout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reliev’d ’em with a fresh supply</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rallied force enough to fly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beat a Tuscan running-horse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose jockey-rider is all spurs.</span>
