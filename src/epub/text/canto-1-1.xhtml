					<p>
						<span>When civil dudgeon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> first grew high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men fell out they knew not why;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When hard words, jealousies, and fears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set folks together by the ears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made them fight, like mad or drunk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For dame Religion as for punk;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose honesty they all durst swear for,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though not a man of them knew wherefore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When gospel-trumpeter, surrounded</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With long-ear’d rout, to battle sounded,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pulpit, drum ecclesiastick,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was beat with fist, instead of a stick;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out he rode a colonelling.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wight he was, whose very sight would</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Entitle him Mirror of Knighthood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never bent his stubborn knee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To any thing but chivalry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor put up blow, but that which laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right worshipful on shoulder-blade:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chief of domestic knights and errant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Either for cartel or for warrant;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great on the bench, great in the saddle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That could as well bind o’er, as swaddle:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mighty he was at both of these,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And styl’d of war, as well as peace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(So some rats, of amphibious nature,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are either for the land or water.)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But here our authors make a doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether he were more wise, or stout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some hold the one, and some the other;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But howsoe’er they make a pother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The diff’rence was so small, his brain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outweigh’d his rage but half a grain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which made some take him for a tool,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That knaves do work with, call’d a fool.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And offer to lay wagers that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Montaigne, playing with his cat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Complains she thought him but an ass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much more she would Sir Hudibras;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For that’s the name our valiant Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all his challenges did write.)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But they’re mistaken very much;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis plain enough he was no such.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We grant, although he had much wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H’ was very shy of using it;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As being loth to wear it out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore bore it not about;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless on holy-days, or so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As men their best apparel do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside, ’tis known he could speak Greek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As naturally as pigs squeak:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Latin was no more difficile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than to a blackbird ’tis to whistle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being rich in both, he never scanted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His bounty unto such as wanted:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But much of either would afford</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To many, that had not one word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Hebrew roots, although they’re found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To flourish most in barren ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had such plenty, as suffic’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make some think him circumcis’d;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And truly so, he was, perhaps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not as a proselyte, but for claps.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He was in logic a great critic,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Profoundly skill’d in analytic;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could distinguish, and divide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hair ’twixt south, and south-west side;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On either which he would dispute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confute, change hands, and still confute.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d undertake to prove, by force</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of argument, a man’s no horse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d prove a buzzard is no fowl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that a lord may be an owl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A calf an alderman, a goose a justice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rooks committee-men and trustees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d run in debt by disputation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pay with ratiocination.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All this by syllogism, true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In mood and figure he would do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Rhetoric, he could not ope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His mouth, but out there flew a trope:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he happen’d to break off</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ th’ middle of his speech, or cough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H’ had hard words,ready to show why,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell what rules he did it by:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Else, when with greatest art he spoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You’d think he talk’d like other folk:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all a rhetorician’s rules</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Teach nothing but to name his tools.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, when he pleas’d to show’t, his speech,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In loftiness of sound was rich;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Babylonish dialect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which learned pedants much affect.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was a parti-colour’d dress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of patch’d and pie-bald languages;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas English cut on Greek and Latin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like fustian heretofore on satin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had an odd promiscuous tone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if h’ had talk’d three parts in one;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which made some think, when he did gabble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ had heard three labourers of Babel;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Cerberus himself pronounce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>A leash of languages at once.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This he as volubly would vent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if his stock would ne’er be spent;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And truly, to support that charge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had supplies as vast and large:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he could coin, or counterfeit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New words, with little or no wit:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Words so debas’d and hard, no stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was hard enough to touch them on:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when with hasty noise he spoke ’em,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ignorant for current took ’em;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That had the orator, who once<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did fill his mouth with pebble stones</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he harangu’d, but known his phrase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would have us’d no other ways.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Mathematicks he was greater</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than Tycho Brahe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> or Erra Pater:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he, by geometric scale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could take the size of pots of ale;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolve, by sines and tangents straight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If bread or butter wanted weight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wisely tell what hour o’ th’ day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clock does strike, by algebra.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside, he was a shrewd philosopher,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had read ev’ry text and gloss over</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whate’er the crabbed’st author hath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He understood b’ implicit faith:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever sceptic could inquire for,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ev’ry why he had a wherefore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knew more than forty of them do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As far as words and terms could go.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All which he understood by rote,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as occasion serv’d, would quote:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No matter whether right or wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They might be either said or sung.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His notions fitted things so well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That which was which he could not tell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But oftentimes mistook the one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For th’ other, as great clerks have done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could reduce all things to acts,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew their natures by abstracts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where entity and quiddity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ghosts of defunct bodies fly;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where truth in person does appear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like words congeal’d in northern air.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He knew what’s what, and that’s as high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As metaphysic wit can fly.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In school-divinity as able</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he that hight, Irrefragable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>A second Thomas, or, at once,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To name them all, another Dunce:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Profound in all the nominal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And real ways, beyond them all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he a rope of sand could twist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As tough as learned Sorbonist;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And weave fine cobwebs, fit for skull</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s empty when the moon is full;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as take lodgings in a head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s to be let unfurnished.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could raise scruples dark and nice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after solve ’em in a trice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if Divinity had catch’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The itch on purpose to be scratch’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or, like a mountebank, did wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stab herself with doubts profound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Only to show with how small pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sores of Faith are cur’d again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although by woeful proof we find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They always leave a scar behind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He knew the seat of Paradise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could tell in what degree it lies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as he was dispos’d, could prove it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Below the moon, or else above it:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What Adam dreamt of, when his bride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came from her closet in his side:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether the devil tempted her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By a High Dutch interpreter;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>If either of them had a navel:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who first made music malleable:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether the serpent, at the fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had cloven feet, or none at all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All this without a gloss or comment,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could unriddle in a moment,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In proper terms, such as men smatter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they throw out, and miss the matter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For his religion, it was fit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To match his learning and his wit:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas Presbyterian true blue;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he was of that stubborn crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of errant saints, whom all men grant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be the true church militant;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as do build their faith upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The holy text of pike and gun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Decide all controversies by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infallible artillery;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prove their doctrine orthodox</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By apostolic blows and knocks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Call fire and sword and desolation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A godly thorough reformation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which always must be carried on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still be doing, never done:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if religion were intended</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For nothing else but to be mended.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sect, whose chief devotion lies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In odd perverse antipathies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In falling out with that or this,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And finding somewhat still amiss;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More peevish, cross, and splenetick,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than dog distract, or monkey sick.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with more care keep holy-day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wrong, than others the right way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compound for sins they are inclin’d to,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By damning those they have no mind to:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still so perverse and opposite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if they worshipp’d God for spite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The self-same thing they will abhor</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One way, and long another for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Free-will they one way disavow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another, nothing else allow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All piety consists therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In them, in other men all sin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rather than fail, they will decry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That which they love most tenderly;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quarrel with minc’d-pies, and disparage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their best and dearest friend, plum-porridge.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fat pig and goose itself oppose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blaspheme custard through the nose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ apostles of this fierce religion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Mahomet’s, were ass and widgeon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whom our Knight, by fast instinct</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wit and temper, was so linkt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if hypocrisy and nonsense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had got th’ advowson of his conscience.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus was he gifted and accouter’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We mean on th’ inside, not the outward;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That next of all we shall discuss:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then listen, Sirs, it follows thus:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tawny beard was th’ equal grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both of his wisdom and his face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In cut and dye so like a tile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sudden view it would beguile:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The upper part thereof was whey;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nether, orange mix’d with grey.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This hairy meteor did denounce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fall of sceptres and of crowns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With grisly type did represent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Declining age of government;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell with hieroglyphick spade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its own grave and the state’s were made.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Samson’s heart-breakers, it grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In time to make a nation rue;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tho’ it contributed its own fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait upon the publick downfall:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was monastick, and did grow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In holy orders by strict vow;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rule as sullen and severe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As that of rigid Cordelier.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas bound to suffer persecution</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And martyrdom with resolution;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ oppose itself against the hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And vengeance of th’ incensed state;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In whose defiance it was worn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still ready to be pull’d and torn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With red-hot irons to be tortur’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revil’d, and spit upon, and martyr’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Maugre all which, ’twas to stand fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As long as monarchy should last;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the state should hap to reel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas to submit to fatal steel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fall, as it was consecrate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sacrifice to fall of state;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose thread of life the fatal sisters</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did twist together with its whiskers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And twine so close, that Time should never,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In life or death, their fortunes sever;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with his rusty sickle mow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both down together at a blow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So learned Taliacotius<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> from</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brawny part of porter’s bum</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cut supplemental noses, which</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would last as long as parent breech;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the date of nock was out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off dropp’d the sympathetic snout.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His back, or rather burthen, show’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if it stoop’d with its own load:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as Æneas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> bore his sire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his shoulders thro’ the fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our Knight did bear no less a pack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his own buttocks on his back;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which now had almost got the upper-</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hand of his head, for want of crupper.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To poise this equally, he bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A paunch of the same bulk before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which still he had a special care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep well-cramm’d with thrifty fare;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As white-pot, butter-milk, and curds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as a country-house affords;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With other vittle, which anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We farther shall dilate upon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When of his hose we come to treat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cupboard where he kept his meat.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His doublet was of sturdy buff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tho’ not sword, yet cudgel-proof;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereby ’twas fitter for his use,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who fear’d no blows, but such as bruise.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His breeches were of rugged woollen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had been at the siege of Bullen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To old king Harry so well known,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some writers held they were his own.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thro’ they were lin’d with many a piece</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ammunition bread and cheese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fat black-puddings, proper food</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For warriors that delight in blood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, as we said, he always chose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To carry vittle in his hose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That often tempted rats and mice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ammunition to surprise:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he put a hand but in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The one or t’ other magazine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They stoutly in defence on’t stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the wounded foe drew blood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And till th’ were storm’d and beaten out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ne’er left the fortify’d redoubt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tho’ knights-errant, as some think,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of old did neither eat nor drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because, when thorough deserts vast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And regions desolate, they past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where belly-timber above ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or under, was not to be found,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless they graz’d, there’s not one word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their provision on record;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which made some confidently write,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They had no stomachs, but to fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis false: for Arthur<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> wore in hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Round table like a farthingal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On which, with shirt pull’d out behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke before, his good knights din’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though ’twas no table, some suppose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But a huge pair of round trunk hose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which he carry’d as much meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he and all the knights could eat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, laying by their swords and truncheons,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They took their breakfasts, or their nuncheons.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But let that pass at present, lest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We should forget where we digrest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As learned authors use, to whom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We leave it, and to th’ purpose come,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His puissant sword unto his side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Near his undaunted heart, was ty’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With basket-hilt, that would hold broth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And serve for fight and dinner both.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In it he melted lead for bullets,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shoot at foes, and sometimes pullets,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whom he bore so fell a grutch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ne’er gave quarter t’ any such.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trenchant blade, Toledo trusty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For want of fighting, was grown rusty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ate unto itself, for lack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of somebody to hew and hack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The peaceful scabbard where it dwelt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rancour of its edge had felt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For of the lower end two handful</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had devour’d, ’twas so manful;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so much scorn’d to lurk in case,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if it durst not shew its face.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In many desperate attempts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of warrants, exigents, contempts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had appear’d with courage bolder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than Serjeant Bum invading shoulder.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft had it ta’en possession,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pris’ners too, or made them run.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This sword a dagger had t’ his page,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That was but little for his age;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore waited on him so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As dwarfs upon knights-errant do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was a serviceable dudgeon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Either for fighting or for drudging.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When it had stabb’d, or broke a head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It would scrape trenchers, or chip bread;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toast cheese or bacon; tho’ it were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bait a mouse-trap, ’twould not care.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould make clean shoes; and in the earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set leeks and onions, and so forth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had been ’prentice to a brewer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where this and more it did endure;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But left the trade, as many more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have lately done on the same score.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In th’ holsters, at his saddle-bow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two aged pistols he did stow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the surplus of such meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in his hose he could not get.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These would inveigle rats with th’ scent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To forage when the cocks were bent:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sometimes catch ’em with a snap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As cleverly as th’ ablest trap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They were upon hard duty still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ev’ry night stood sentinel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guard the magazine i’ the hose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From two-legg’d and from four-legg’d foes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus clad and fortify’d, Sir Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From peaceful home set forth to fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But first with nimble, active force</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He got on th’ outside of his horse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For having but one stirrup ty’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ his saddle, on the farther side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was so short h’ had much ado</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reach it with his desp’rate toe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But after many strains and heaves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He got up to the saddle-eaves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whence he vaulted into th’ seat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so much vigour, strength and heat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had almost tumbled over</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With his own weight, but did recover,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By laying hold on tail and mane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which oft he us’d instead of rein.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But now we talk of mounting steed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before we further do proceed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It doth behove us to say something</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that which bore our valiant bumpkin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The beast was sturdy, large, and tall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With mouth of meal, and eyes of wall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I would say eye; for h’ had but one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As most agree; tho’ some say none.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was well stay’d; and in his gait</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Preserv’d a grave, majestick state.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At spur or switch no more he skipt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or mended pace, than Spaniard whipt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet so fiery, he would bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if he griev’d to touch the ground:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Caesar’s horse who, as fame goes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had corns upon his feet and toes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was not by half so tender hooft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor trod upon the ground so soft.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as that beast would kneel and stoop</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Some write) to take his rider up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Hudibras his (’tis well known)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would often do to set him down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We shall not need to say what lack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of leather was upon his back;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For that was hidden under pad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And breech of Knight, gall’d full as bad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His strutting ribs on both sides show’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like furrows he himself had plow’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For underneath the skirt of pannel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt ev’ry two there was a channel.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His draggling tail hung in the dirt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which on his rider he would flirt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still as his tender side he prick’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With arm’d heel, or with unarm’d, kick’d;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Hudibras wore but one spur;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wisely knowing, could he stir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To active trot one side of ’s horse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other would not hang an arse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A squire he had, whose name was Ralph,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in th’ adventure went his half:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though writers, for more stately tone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do call him Ralpho; ’tis all one;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when we can with metre safe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We’ll call him so; if not, plain Ralph.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For rhyme the rudder is of verses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which like ships they steer their courses.)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An equal stock of wit and valour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had laid in; by birth a tailor.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mighty Tyrian queen, that gain’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With subtle shreds a tract of land,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did leave it with a castle fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To his great ancestor, her heir.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From him descended cross-legg’d knights,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fam’d for their faith, and warlike fights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the bloody cannibal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom they destroy’d both great and small.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This sturdy Squire he had, as well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As the bold Trojan knight, seen Hell;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not with a counterfeited pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of golden bough, but true gold-lace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His knowledge was not far behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight’s, but of another kind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he another way came by ’t:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some call it Gifts, and some New-Light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A liberal art that costs no pains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of study, industry, or brains.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His wit was sent him for a token,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in the carriage crack’d and broken.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like commendation nine-pence crook’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With⁠—To and from my love⁠—it look’d.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ne’er consider’d it, as loth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To look a gift-horse in the mouth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And very wisely would lay forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No more upon it than ’twas worth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as he got it freely, so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spent it frank and freely too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Saints themselves will sometimes be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gifts that cost them nothing, free.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By means of this, with hem and cough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prolongers to enlighten’d stuff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could deep mysteries unriddle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As easily as thread a needle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as of vagabonds we say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they are ne’er beside their way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whate’er men speak by this New Light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still they are sure to be i’ th’ right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis a dark-lantern of the spirit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which none see by but those that bear it:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A light that falls down from on high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For spiritual trades to cozen by:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An ignis fatuus, that bewitches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leads men into pools and ditches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make them dip themselves, and sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Christendom in dirty pond;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To dive like wild-fowl for salvation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fish to catch regeneration.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This light inspires and plays upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nose of saint like bag-pipe drone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And speaks through hollow empty soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As through a trunk, or whisp’ring hole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such language as no mortal ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But spirit’al eaves-droppers can hear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Phœbus, or some friendly muse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into small poets’ song infuse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which they at second-hand rehearse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thro’ reed or bag-pipe, verse for verse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus Ralph became infallible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As three or four-legg’d oracle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ancient cup, or modern chair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spoke truth point-blank, tho’ unaware.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For mystick learning, wondrous able</span>

						<span>In magick Talisman and Cabal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>Deep sighted in intelligences,</span>

						<span>Th’ intelligible world, could say:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>A deep occult Philosopher,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As learn’d as the wild Irish are,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Sir Agrippa; for profound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And solid lying much renown’d.</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>Knew many an amulet and charm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That would do neither good nor harm:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Rosy-crucian lore as learned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he that <i xml:lang="la">Vere adeptus</i> earned.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He understood the speech of birds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as they themselves do words;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou’d tell what subtlest parrots mean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That speak, and think contrary clean:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What member ’tis of whom they talk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they cry Rope, and Walk, knave, walk.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d extract numbers out of matter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And keep them in a glass, like water;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sov’reign pow’r to make men wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For drop’d in blear thick-sighted eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’d make them see in darkest night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like owls, tho’ purblind in the light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By help of these (as he profess’d)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had First Matter seen undress’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He took her naked all alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before one rag of form was on.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Chaos too he had descry’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seen quite thro’, or else he ly’d:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not that of paste-board which men shew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For groats, at fair of Barthol’mew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But its great grandsire, first o’ the name,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence that and Reformation came;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both cousin-germans, and right able</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ inveigle and draw in the rabble.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Reformation was, some say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ younger house to Puppet-play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could foretel whats’ever was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By consequence to come to pass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As death of great men, alterations,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Diseases, battles, inundations,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All this, without th’ eclipse o’ th’ sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or dreadful comet, he hath done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By inward light; away as good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And easy to be understood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with more lucky hit than those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That use to make the stars depose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like knights o’ th’ post, and falsely charge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon themselves what others forge:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if they were consenting to</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All mischiefs in the world men do:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or, like the Devil, did tempt and sway ’em</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rogueries, and then betray ’em.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll search a planet’s house, to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who broke and robb’d a house below:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Examine Venus, and the Moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who stole a thimble or a spoon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tho’ they nothing will confess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet by their very looks can guess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell what guilty aspect bodes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who stole, and who receiv’d the goods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll question Mars, and by his look,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Detect who ’twas that nimm’d a cloke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make Mercury confess, and ’peach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those thieves which he himself did teach.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll find, i’ th’ physiognomies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ planets, all men’s destinies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like him that took the doctor’s bill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swallow’d it instead o’ th’ pill:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cast the nativity o’ th’ question,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from positions to be guess’d on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As sure as if they knew the moment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of natives birth, tell what will come on’t.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll feel the pulses of the stars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find out agues, coughs, catarrhs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell what crisis does divine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rot in sheep, or mange in swine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In men, what gives or cures the itch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What makes them cuckolds, poor or rich;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What gains or loses, hangs or saves;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What makes men great, what fools or knaves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But not what wise; for only of those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stars (they say) cannot dispose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No more than can the astrologians.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There they say right, and like true Trojans.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Ralpho knew, and therefore took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other course, of which we spoke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus was the accomplish’d Squire endu’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gifts and knowledge, per’lous shrewd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never did trusty Squire with Knight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Knight with Squire, e’er jump more right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their arms and equipage did fit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as virtues, parts, and wit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their valours too were of a rate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out they sally’d at the gate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Few miles on horseback had they jogged,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Fortune unto them turn’d dogged;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For they a sad adventure met,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which anon we mean to treat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ere we venture to unfold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Achievements so resolv’d and bold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We should as learned poets use,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invoke the assistance of some muse:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However, critics count it sillier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than jugglers talking to familiar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We think ’tis no great matter which;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’re all alike; yet we shall pitch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On one that fits our purpose most</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom therefore thus do we accost:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thou that with ale, or viler liquors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did’st inspire Withers, Pryn, and Vickars,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And force them, tho’ it was in spite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of nature and their stars, to write;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, as we find in sullen writs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cross-grain’d works of modern wits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With vanity, opinion, want,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wonder of the ignorant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The praises of the author, penn’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B’ himself, or wit-ensuring friend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The itch of picture in the front,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bays and wicked rhyme upon’t;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All that is left o’ th’ forked hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make men scribble without skill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Canst make a poet spite of fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And teach all people to translate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tho’ out of languages in which</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They understand no part of speech;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assist me but this once, I ’mplore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I shall trouble thee no more.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In western clime there is a town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To those that dwell therein well known;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore there needs no more be said here;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We unto them refer our reader;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For brevity is very good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When w’ are, or are not, understood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To this town people did repair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On days of market, or of fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, to crack’d fiddle, and hoarse tabor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In merriment did drudge and labour.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now a sport more formidable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had rak’d together village rabble;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas an old way of recreating,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which learned butchers call bear-baiting:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bold advent’rous exercise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ancient heroes in high prize:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For authors do affirm it came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Isthmian or Nemean game:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Others derive it from the bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s fix’d in northern hemisphere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And round about the pole does make</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A circle like a bear at stake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That at the chain’s end wheels about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And overturns the rabble-rout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For after solemn proclamation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the bear’s name, (as is the fashion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>According to the law of arms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep men from inglorious harms,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That none presume to come so near</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As forty foot of stake of bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If any yet be so fool-hardy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T’ expose themselves to vain jeopardy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If they come wounded off, and lame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No honour’s got by such a maim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Altho’ the bear gain much, b’ing bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In honour to make good his ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he’s engag’d, and takes no notice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If any press upon him, who ’tis;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But let’s them know, at their own cost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he intends to keep his post.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This to prevent, and other harms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which always wait on feats of arms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For in the hurry of a fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis hard to keep out of harm’s way,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thither the Knight his course did steer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep the peace ’twixt dog and bear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he believ’d he was bound to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In conscience, and commission too;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore thus bespoke the Squire:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We that are wisely mounted higher<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than constables in curule wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When on tribunal bench we sit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like speculators should foresee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Pharos of authority,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Portended mischiefs farther then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Low Proletarian tything-men:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore being inform’d by bruit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dog and bear are to dispute;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For so of late men fighting name,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because they often prove the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For where the first does hap to be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last does coincidere;)</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i xml:lang="la">Quantum in nobis</i>, have thought good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To save th’ expense of Christian blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And try if we, by mediation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of treaty and accommodation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can end the quarrel and compose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bloody duel without blows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are not our liberties, our lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The laws, religion, and our wives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enough at once to lie at stake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Cov’nant and the Cause’s sake?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in that quarrel dogs and bears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as we, must venture theirs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This feud, by Jesuits invented,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By evil counsel is fomented;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is a Machiavelian plot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Tho’ every nare olfact is not,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A deep design in’t, to divide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The well-affected that confide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By setting brother against brother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To claw and curry one another.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have we not enemies, <i xml:lang="la">plus satis</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, <i xml:lang="la">cane et angue pejus</i>, hate us?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shall we turn our fangs and claws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon our own selves, without cause?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That some occult design doth lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In bloody cynarctomachy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is plain enough to him that knows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How saints lead brothers by the nose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I wish myself a pseudo-prophet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sure some mischief will come of it;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless by providential wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or force, we averruncate it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-46" id="noteref-46" epub:type="noteref">46</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what design, what interest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can beast have to encounter beast?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They fight for no espoused cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Frail privilege, fundamental laws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not for a thorough reformation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor covenant, nor protestation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor liberty of consciences,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor Lords and Commons’ ordinances;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor for the church, nor for church-lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To get them in their own no-hands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor evil counsellors to bring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To justice that seduce the king;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor for the worship of us men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though we have done as much for them.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ Egyptians worshipp’d dogs, and for</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their faith made internecine war.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Others ador’d a rat, and some</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For that church suffer’d martyrdom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Indians fought for the truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of th’ elephant and monkey’s tooth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many, to defend that faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fought it out, <i xml:lang="la">mordicus</i>, to death.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But no beast ever was so slight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For man, as for his God, to fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They have more wit, alas! and know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Themselves and us better than so.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But we, who only do infuse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rage in them like Boute-feus;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-48" id="noteref-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis our example that instils</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In them th’ infection of our ills.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, as some late philosophers.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have well observ’d, beasts that converse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With man, take after him, as hogs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Get pigs all th’ year, and bitches dogs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just so, by our example, cattle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Learn to give one another battle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We read, in Nero’s time, the heathen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they destroy’d the Christian brethren,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did sew them in the skins of bears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then set dogs about their ears:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From thence, no doubt, th’ invention came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of this lewd antichristian game.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To this, quoth Ralpho, Verily</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The point seems very plain to me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is an antichristian game,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unlawful both in thing and name.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First, for the name: the word, bear-baiting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is carnal, and of man’s creating:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For certainly there’s no such word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the Scripture on record;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore unlawful, and a sin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so is (secondly) the thing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A vile assembly ’tis, that can</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No more be prov’d by Scripture than</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provincial, classic, national;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mere human creature-cobwebs all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thirdly, it is idolatrous;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when men run a whoring thus</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With their inventions, whatsoe’er</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The thing be, whether dog or bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is idolatrous and pagan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No less than worshipping of Dagon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth Hudibras, I smell a rat:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ralpho, thou dost prevaricate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though the thesis which thou lay’st</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be true <i xml:lang="la">ad amussim</i>, as thou say’st;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For that bear-baiting should appear</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i xml:lang="la">Jure divino</i>, lawfuller</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than synods are, thou dost deny,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Totidem verbis: so do I;)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet there’s a fallacy in this;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if by sly homœosis,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i xml:lang="la">Tussis pro crepitu</i>, an art</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under a cough to slur a fart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou wouldst sophistically imply</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both are unlawful, I deny.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And I (quoth Ralpho) do not doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But bear-baiting may be made out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In gospel-times, as lawful as is</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provincial or parochial classis;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that both are so near of kin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like in all, as well as sin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That put them in a bag, and shake ’em,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yourself o’ th’ sudden would mistake ’em,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not know which is which, unless</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You measure by their wickedness:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’tis not hard t’imagine whether</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’ th’ two is worst; tho’ I name neither.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth Hudibras, Thou offer’st much,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But art not able to keep touch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i xml:lang="es">Mira de lente</i>, as ’tis i’ th’ adage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Id est, to make a leek a cabbage;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou wilt at best but such a bull,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or shear-swine, all cry and no wool;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what can synods have at all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bear that’s analogical?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or what relation has debating</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of church-affairs with bear-baiting?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A just comparison still is</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of things ejusdem generis;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then what genius rightly doth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Include and comprehend them both?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If animal, both of us may</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As justly pass for bears as they;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For we are animals no less,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Altho’ of different specieses.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, Ralpho, this is no fit place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor time to argue out the case:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the field is not far off,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where we must give the world a proof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of deeds, not words, and such as suit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another manner of dispute;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A controversy that affords</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Actions for arguments, not words;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which we must manage at a rate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of prowess and conduct adequate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To what our place and fame doth promise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the godly expect from us.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor shall they be deceiv’d, unless</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We’re slurr’d and outed by success;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Success, the mark no mortal wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or surest hand, can always hit:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whatsoe’er we perpetrate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We do but row, we’re steer’d by Fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which in success oft disinherits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For spurious causes, noblest merits.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great actions are not always true sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of great and mighty resolutions;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor do th’ boldest attempts bring forth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Events still equal to their worth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sometimes fail, and in their stead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fortune and cowardice succeed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet we have no great cause to doubt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our actions still have borne us out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, tho’ they’re known to be so ample,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We need not copy from example.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We’re not the only persons durst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attempt this province, nor the first.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In northern clime a val’rous knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did whilom kill his bear in fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wound a fiddler; we have both</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of these the objects of our wroth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And equal fame and glory from</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th’ attempt of victory to come.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis sung, there is a valiant Mamaluke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-49" id="noteref-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In foreign land, yclep’d⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whom we have been oft compar’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For person, parts, address, and beard;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both equally reputed stout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the same cause both have fought;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He oft in such attempts as these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came off with glory and success;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor will we fail in th’ execution,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For want of equal resolution.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honour is like a widow, won<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brisk attempt and putting on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ent’ring manfully, and urging;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not slow approaches, like a virgin.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Tis said, as erst the Phrygian knight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ours with rusty steel did smite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Trojan horse, and just as much</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He mended pace upon the touch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But from his empty stomach groan’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just as that hollow beast did sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And angry answer’d from behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brandish’d tail and blast of wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So have I seen, with armed heel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wight bestride a common-weal;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While still the more he kick’d and spurr’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The less the sullen jade had stirr’d.</span>
