				<span>Who would believe what strange bugbears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mankind creates itself, of fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That spring like fern, that insect weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Equivocally, without seed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have no possible foundation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But merely in th’ imagination;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet can do more dreadful feats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hags, with all their imps and teats;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-199" id="noteref-199" epub:type="noteref">199</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make more bewitch and haunt themselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all their nurseries of elves?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear does things so like a witch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis hard t’ unriddle which is which.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sets up Communities of senses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chop and change intelligences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Rosicrucian virtuosos<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-200" id="noteref-200" epub:type="noteref">200</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can see with ears, and hear with noses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they neither see nor hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have more than both supply’d by fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes ’em in the dark see visions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hag themselves with apparitions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when their eyes discover least,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Discern the subtlest objects best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do things not contrary, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To th’ course of nature, but its own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The courage of the bravest daunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn poltroons as valiant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men as resolute appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With too much as too little fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they’re out of hopes of flying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will run away from death, by dying;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or turn again to stand it out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those they fled, like lions, rout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This Hudibras had prov’d too true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, by the furies left perdue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And haunted with detachments, sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Marshal Legion’s regiment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-201" id="noteref-201" epub:type="noteref">201</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was by a fiend, as counterfeit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reliev’d and rescu’d with a cheat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When nothing but himself, and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was both the imp and conjurer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, by the rules o’ th’ virtuosi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It follows in due form of poesie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Disguis’d in all the masks of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We left our champion on his flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At blindman’s buff, to grope his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In equal fear of night and day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who took his dark and desp’rate course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knew no better than his horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, by an unknown devil led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(He knew as little whither) fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never was in greater need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor less capacity, of speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disabled, both in man and beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fly and run away his best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the enemy, and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From equal falling on his rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though with kicks and bangs he ply’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The further and the nearer side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As seamen ride with all their force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tug as if they row’d the horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the hackney sails most swift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believe they lag, or run adrift,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, though he posted e’er so fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His fear was greater than his haste:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear, though fleeter than the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believes ’tis always left behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the morn began t’ appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shift t’ another scene his fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found his new officious shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That came so timely to his aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forc’d him from the foe t’ escape,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had turn’d itself to Ralpho’s shape;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like in person, garb, and pitch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas hard t’ interpret which was which.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Ralpho had no sooner told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lady all he had t’ unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she convey’d him out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To entertain th’ approaching Knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, while he gave himself diversion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ accommodate his beast and person,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put his beard into a posture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At best advantage to accost her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She ordered the anti-masquerade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For his reception) aforesaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the ceremony was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lights put out, and furies gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hudibras, among the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Convey’d away, as Ralpho guess’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wretched caitiff, all alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As he believ’d) began to moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell his story to himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Knight mistook him for an elf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did so still, till he began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To scruple at Ralph’s outward man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought, because they oft agreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ appear in one another’s stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And act the saint’s and devil’s part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With undistinguishable art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might have done so now, perhaps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put on one another’s shapes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore, to resolve the doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He star’d upon him, and cry’d out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What art? My Squire, or that bold sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That took his place and shape to-night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some busy, independent pug,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retainer to his synagogue?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! quoth he, I’m none of those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your bosom friends, as you suppose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Ralph himself, your trusty Squire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wh’ has dragg’d your Donship out o’ th’ mire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the enchantments of a widow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wh’ had turn’d you int’ a beast, have freed you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, though a prisoner of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have brought you safe where you now are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which you would gratefully repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your constant Presbyterian way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That’s stranger (quoth the Knight) and stranger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who gave thee notice of my danger?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, Th’ infernal conjurer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursu’d and took me prisoner;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knowing you were hereabout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought me along to find you out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I, in hugger-mugger hid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have noted all they said or did:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though they lay to him the pageant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I did not see him, nor his agent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who play’d their sorceries out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ avoid a fiercer second fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But didst thou see no devils then?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one (quoth he) but carnal men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little worse than fiends in hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that she-devil Jezebel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That laugh’d and tee-he’d with derision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see them take your deposition.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What then (quoth Hudibras) was he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That play’d the dev’l to examine me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rallying weaver in the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That did it in a parson’s gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom all the parish take for gifted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, for my part, I ne’er believ’d it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which you told them all your feats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your conscientious frauds and cheats;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deny’d your whipping, and confest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The naked truth of all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More plainly than the rev’rend writer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-202" id="noteref-202" epub:type="noteref">202</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to our churches veil’d his mitre;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All which they took in black and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cudgell’d me to under-write.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What made thee, when they all were gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none but thou and I alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To act the devil, and forbear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rid me of my hellish fear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, I knew your constant rate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And frame of sp’rit too obstinate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be by me prevail’d upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With any motives of my own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore strove to counterfeit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dev’l a-while, to nick your wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dev’l, that is your constant crony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That only can prevail upon ye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else we might still have been disputing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they with weighty drubs confuting.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Knight who now began to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ had left the enemy behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw no farther harm remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But feeble weariness and pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perceiv’d, by losing of their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ had gain’d th’ advantage of the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, by declining of the road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had, by chance, their rear made good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He ventur’d to dismiss his fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That parting’s want to rent and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And give the desperat’st attack</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To danger still behind its back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For having paus’d to recollect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his past success reflect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ examine and consider why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whence, and how, they came to fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when no devil had appear’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What else, it could be said, he fear’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It put him in so fierce a rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He once resolv’d to re-engage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toss’d like a foot-ball back again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shame and vengeance, and disdain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth he, It was thy cowardice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made me from this leaguer rise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I’d half reduc’d the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To quit it infamously base:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was better cover’d by the new-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arriv’d detachment than I knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slight my new acquests, and run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victoriously from battles won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reck’ning all I gain’d or lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sell them cheaper than they cost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make me put myself to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conqu’ring run away by night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drag me out, which th’ haughty foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Durst never have presum’d to do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mount me in the dark, by force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the bare ridge of my horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expos’d in querpo to their rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without my arms and equipage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest, if they ventur’d to pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might th’ unequal fight renew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, to preserve thy outward man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assum’d my place, and led the van.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All this quoth Ralph, I did, ’tis true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to preserve my self, but you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You, who were damn’d to baser drubs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than wretches feel in powd’ring tubs?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mount two-wheel’d caroches, worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than managing a wooden-horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dragg’d out through straiter holes by th’ ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eras’d or coup’d for perjurers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, though th’ attempt had prov’d in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had had no reason to complain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since it prosper’d, ’tis unhandsome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blame the hand that paid our ransom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rescu’d your obnoxious bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From unavoidable battoons.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The enemy was reinforc’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we disabled, and unhors’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disarm’d, unqualify’d for fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no way left but hasty flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which though as desp’rate in th’ attempt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has giv’n you freedom to condemn ’t.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But were our bones in fit condition</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reinforce the expedition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis now unseasonable, and vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think of falling on again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No martial project to surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever be attempted twice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor can design serve afterwards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As gamesters tear their losing-cards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside our bangs of man and beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are fit for nothing now but rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for a while will not be able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rally and prove serviceable;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore I, with reason, chose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This stratagem t’ amuse our foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make an honourable retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wave a total sure defeat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those that fly may fight again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he can never do that’s slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence timely running’s no mean part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of conduct in the martial art;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By which some glorious feats achieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As citizens by breaking thrive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cannons conquer armies, while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They seem to draw off and recoil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is held the gallant’st course, and bravest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To great exploits, as well as safest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That spares th’ expense of time and pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dangerous beating out of brains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the end prevails as certain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As those that never trust to fortune;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But make their fear do execution</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the stoutest resolution;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As earthquakes kill without a blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, only trembling, overthrow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If th’ ancients crown’d their bravest men,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-203" id="noteref-203" epub:type="noteref">203</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That only sav’d a citizen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What victory could e’er be won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If ev’ry one would save but one?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fight endanger’d to be lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all resolve to save the most?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this means when a battle’s won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The war’s as far from being done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those that save themselves, and fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go halves, at least, i’ th’ victory;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sometimes, when the loss is small,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And danger great, they challenge all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Print new additions to their feats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And emendations in Gazettes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when, for furious haste to run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They durst not stay to fire a gun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have done ’t with bonfires, and at home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made squibs and crackers overcome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To set the rabble on a flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keep their governors from blame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disperse the news the pulpit tells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confirm’d with fire-works and with bells;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though reduc’d to that extreme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have been forc’d to sing Te Deum;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, with religious blasphemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By flattering Heaven with a lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for their beating giving thanks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ have rais’d recruits, and fill’d their banks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those who run from th’ enemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engage them equally to fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the fight becomes a chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those win the day that win the race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that which would not pass in fights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has done the feat with easy flights;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recover’d many a desp’rate campaign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champaign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Restor’d the fainting high and mighty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With brandy-wine and aqua-vitae;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made ’em stoutly overcome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bachrach, hoccamore, and mum;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom th’ uncontroll’d decrees of fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To victory necessitate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which, although they run or burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They unavoidably return:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else their sultan populaces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still strangle all their routed Bassas.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-204" id="noteref-204" epub:type="noteref">204</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Hudibras, I understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What fights thou mean’st at sea and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who those were that run away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet gave out th’ had won the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although the rabble sous’d them for ’t,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er head and ears in mud and dirt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis true, our modern way of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is grown more politic by far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not so resolute and bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ty’d to honour, as the old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now they laugh at giving battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless it be to herds of cattle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fighting convoys of provision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole design o’ the expedition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not with downright blows to rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The enemy, but eat them out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fighting, in all beasts of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eating, are perform’d one way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give defiance to their teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fight their stubborn guts to death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those achieve the high’st renown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bring the others’ stomachs down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s now no fear of wounds, nor maiming;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All dangers are reduc’d to famine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feats of arms, to plot, design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surprise, and stratagem, and mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But have no need nor use of courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless it be for glory or forage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if they fight, ’tis but by chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When one side vent’ring to advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And come uncivilly too near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are charg’d unmercifully i’ th’ rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forc’d, with terrible resistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep hereafter at a distance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pick out ground t’ encamp upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where store of largest rivers run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That serve, instead of peaceful barriers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To part th’ engagements of their warriors;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where both from side to side may skip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only encounter at bo-peep:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men are found the stouter-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The certainer th’ are to be parted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore post themselves in bogs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As th’ ancient mice attack’d the frogs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made their mortal enemy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The water-rat, their strict ally.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ’tis not now, who’s stout and bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But who bears hunger best, and cold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he’s approv’d the most deserving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who longest can hold out at starving;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he that routs most pigs and cows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The formidablest man of prowess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So th’ emperor Caligula,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That triumph’d o’er the British Sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took crabs and oysters prisoners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lobsters, ’stead of cuirassiers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engag’d his legions in fierce bustles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With periwinkles, prawns, and muscles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And led his troops with furious gallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To charge whole regiments of scallops;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not like their ancient way of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wait on his triumphal car;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he went to dine or sup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More bravely eat his captives up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left all war, by his example,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reduc’d to vict’ling of a camp well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Ralph, By all that you have said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And twice as much that I could add,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis plain you cannot now do worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than take this out-of-fashion’d course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hope, by stratagem, to woo her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or waging battle to subdue her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though some have done it in romances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bang’d them into amorous fancies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As those who won the Amazons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By wanton drubbing of their bones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stout Rinaldo gain’d his bride,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>By courting of her back and side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since those times and feats are over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are not for a modern lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When mistresses are too cross-grain’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By such addresses to be gain’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if they were, would have it out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With many another kind of bout.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore I hold no course s’ infeasible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As this of force, to win the Jezebel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To storm her heart, by th’ antic charms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ladies errant, force of arms:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rather strive by law to win her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And try the title you have in her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your case is clear; you have her word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And me to witness the accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides two more of her retinue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To testify what pass’d between you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More probable, and like to hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hand, or seal, or breaking gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which so many that renounc’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their plighted contracts have been trounc’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bills upon record been found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That forc’d the ladies to compound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that, unless I miss the matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all the bus’ness you look after.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides, encounters at the bar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are braver now than those in war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which the law does execution</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With less disorder and confusion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has more of honour in ’t, some hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not like the new way, but the old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When those the pen had drawn together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decided quarrels with the feather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winged arrows kill’d as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more than bullets now of lead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So all their combats now, as then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are manag’d chiefly by the pen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That does the feat with braver vigours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In words at length, as well as figures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is judge of all the world performs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In voluntary feats of arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whatsoe’er ’s achiev’d in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Determines which is wrong or right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whether you prevail, or lose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All must be try’d there in the close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore ’tis not wise to shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What you must trust to ere y’ have done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The law, that settles all you do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marries where you did but woo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes the most perfidious lover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lady, that’s as false, recover;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if it judge upon your side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will soon extend her for your bride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put her person, goods, or lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or which you like best, int’ your hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For law’s the wisdom of all ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And manag’d by the ablest sages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, though their bus’ness at the bar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be but a kind of civil war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which th’ engage with fiercer dudgeons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than e’er the Grecians did and Trojans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never manage the contest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ impair their public interest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or by their controversies lessen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dignity of their profession:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not like us brethren, who divide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our commonwealth, the cause, and side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though w’ are all as near of kindred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As th’ outward man is to the inward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We agree in nothing but to wrangle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the slightest fingle-fangle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While lawyers have more sober sense</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than t’ argue at their own expense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But make their best advantages</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of others’ quarrels, like the Swiss;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of foreign controversies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By aiding both sides fill their purses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But have no int’rest in the cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which th’ engage, and wage the laws;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor further prospect than their pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether they lose or win the day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though they abounded in all ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sundry learned clerks and sages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though all their business be dispute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which way they canvass ev’ry suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ have no disputes about their art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor in polemics controvert;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all professions else are found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With nothing but disputes t’ abound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divines of all sorts, and physicians,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Philosophers, mathematicians,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Galenist and Paracelsian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Condemn the way each other deals in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anatomists dissect and mangle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cut themselves out work to wrangle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Astrologers dispute their dreams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in their sleeps they talk of schemes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heralds stickle who got who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many hundred years ago.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But lawyers are too wise a nation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ expose their trade to disputation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or make the busy rabble judges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all their secret piques and grudges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which whoever wins the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole profession ’s sure to pay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside, no mountebanks, nor cheats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dare undertake to do their feats;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in all other sciences</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They swarm, like insects, and increase.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For what bigot durst ever draw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By inward light, a deed in law?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or could hold forth, by revelation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An answer to a declaration?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those that meddle with their tools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will cut their fingers, if they’re fools:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if you follow their advice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In bills, and answers, and replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ll write a love-letter in chancery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall bring her upon oath to answer ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soon reduce her to b’ your wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or make her weary of her life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Knight, who us’d with tricks and shifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To edify by Ralpho’s gifts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in appearance cry’d him down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make them better seem his own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(All plagiaries’ constant course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sinking when they take a purse)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resolv’d to follow his advice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept it from him by disguise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after stubborn contradiction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To counterfeit his own conviction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by transition fall upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The resolution as his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, This gambol thou advisest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is of all others the unwisest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if I think by law to gain her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s nothing sillier or vainer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis but to hazard my pretence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where nothing’s certain, but th’ expense;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To act against myself, and traverse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My suit and title, to her favours;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if she should (which Heav’n forbid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’erthrow me, as the fiddler did,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What after-course have I to take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst losing all I have at stake?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that with injury is griev’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And goes to law to be reliev’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is sillier than a sottish chouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, when thief has robb’d his house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applies himself to cunning men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help him to his goods agen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all he can expect to gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but to squander more in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I have no other way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is as difficult to play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For to reduce her by main force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is now in vain: by fair means, worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But worst of all to give her over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till she’s as desp’rate to recover:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For bad games are thrown up too soon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until th’ are never to be won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I have no other course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is as bad t’ attempt, or worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that complies against his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is of his own opinion still;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he may adhere to, yet disown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For reasons to himself best known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ’tis not to b’ avoided now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Sidrophel resolves to sue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom I must answer, or begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inevitably first with him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I’ve receiv’d advertisement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By times enough, of his intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knowing he that first complains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ advantage of the business gains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For courts of justice understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The plaintiff to be eldest hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who what he pleases may aver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other, nothing, till he swear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is freely admitted to all grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lawful favour, by his place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for his bringing custom in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has all advantages to win:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, who resolve to oversee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No lucky opportunity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will go to council, to advise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which way t’ encounter, or surprise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after long consideration,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have found out one to fit th’ occasion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most apt for what I have to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As counsellor and justice too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truly so, no doubt, he was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lawyer fit for such a case.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An old dull sot, who told the clock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-207" id="noteref-207" epub:type="noteref">207</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For many years at Bridewell-dock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Westminster, and Hicks’s-Hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hiccius Doctius play’d in all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, in all governments and times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>H’ had been both friend and foe to crimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And us’d two equal ways of gaining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By hind’ring justice, or maintaining;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To many a whore gave privilege,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whipp’d for want of quarteradge;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cart-loads of bawds to prison sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For b’ing behind a fortnight’s rent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a trusty pimp and crony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Puddle-dock, for want of money;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-208" id="noteref-208" epub:type="noteref">208</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Engag’d the constable to seize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All those that would not break the peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor give him back his own foul words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though sometimes commoners or lords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kept ’em prisoners of course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For being sober at ill hours;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in the morning he might free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or bind ’em over for his fee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made monsters fine, and puppet-plays,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-209" id="noteref-209" epub:type="noteref">209</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For leave to practise in their ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farm’d out all cheats, and went a share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With th’ headborough and scavenger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made the dirt i’ th’ streets compound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For taking up the public ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kennel, and the king’s highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For being unmolested, pay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let out the stocks, and whipping-post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cage, to those that gave him most;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impos’d a tax on bakers’ ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for false weights on chandeliers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made victuallers and vintners fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For arbitrary ale and wine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But was a kind and constant friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all that regularly offend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As residentiary bawds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brokers that receive stol’n goods;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cheat in lawful mysteries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pay church duties and his fees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But was implacable, and awkward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all that interlop’d and hawker’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To this brave man the Knight repairs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For council in his law-affairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found him mounted in his pew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With books and money plac’d for show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like nest-eggs, to make clients lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for his false opinion pay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the knight, with comely grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put off his hat to put his case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he as proudly entertain’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As th’ other courteously strain’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, to assure him ’twas not that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He look’d for, bid him put on ’s hat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth he, There is one Sidrophel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom I have cudgell’d⁠—Very well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now he brags t’ have beaten me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better and better still, quoth he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vows to stick me to a wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where’er he meets me⁠—Best of all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis true, the knave has taken ’s oath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I robb’d him⁠—Well done, in troth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When h’ has confess’d he stole my cloak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pick’d my fob, and what he took;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was the cause that made me bang him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take my goods again⁠—Marry, hang him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now whether I should before-hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear he robb’d me?⁠—I understand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or bring my action of conversion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trover for my goods?⁠—Ah, whoreson!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if ’tis better to indite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring him to his trial?⁠—Right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prevent what he designs to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swear for th’ state against him?⁠—True.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether he that is defendant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this case has the better end on ’t;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, putting in a new cross-bill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May traverse th’ action?⁠—Better still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then there’s a Lady too⁠—Aye, marry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s easily prov’d accessary;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A widow, who, by solemn vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contracted to me, for my spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Combin’d with him to break her word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And has abetted all⁠—Good Lord!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suborn’d th’ aforesaid Sidrophel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tamper with the dev’l of hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who put m’ into a horrid fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear of my life⁠—Make that appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made an assault with fiends and men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my body⁠—Good agen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kept me in a deadly fright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And false imprisonment, all night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile they robb’d me, and my horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stole my saddle⁠—Worse and worse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made me mount upon the bare ridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ avoid a wretcheder miscarriage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir, quoth the Lawyer, not to flatter ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You have as good and fair a battery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As heart can wish, and need not shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The proudest man alive to claim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if th’ have us’d you as you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marry, quoth I, God give you joy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would it were my case, I’d give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than I’ll say, or you’ll believe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would so trounce her, and her purse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d make her kneel for better or worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For matrimony and hanging here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both go by destiny so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you as sure may pick and choose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Cross, I win; and, Pile, you lose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, if I durst, I would advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As much in ready maintenance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As upon any case I’ve known;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we that practise dare not own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The law severely contrabands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our taking bus’ness off men’s hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis common barratry, that bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point-blank an action ’gainst our ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crops them till there is not leather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stick a pin in left of either;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which some do the summer-sault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the bar, like tumblers, vault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But you may swear, at any rate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Things not in nature, for the state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in all courts of justice here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A witness is not said to swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But make oath; that is, in plain terms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To forge whatever he affirms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I thank you, (quoth the Knight) for that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because ’tis to my purpose pat⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Justice, though she’s painted blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is to the weaker side inclin’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like Charity; else right and wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could never hold it out so long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like blind Fortune, with a sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Convey mens’ interest and right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Stiles’s pocket into Nokes’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-210" id="noteref-210" epub:type="noteref">210</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>As easily as Hocus Pocus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play fast and loose; make men obnoxious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clear again, like Hiccius Doctius.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then whether you would take her life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or but recover her for your wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or be content with what she has,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let all other matters pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bus’ness to the law ’s alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The proof is all it looks upon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you can want no witnesses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swear to any thing you please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hardly get their mere expenses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By th’ labour of their consciences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or letting out to hire their ears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To affidavit customers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At inconsiderable values,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve for jury-men or tallies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although retain’d in th’ hardest matters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of trustees and administrators.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For that, quoth he, let me alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>W’ have store of such, and all our own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bred up and tutor’d by our teachers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ablest of conscience-stretchers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That’s well, quoth he; but I should guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By weighing all advantages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your surest way is first to pitch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Bongey for a water-witch;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-211" id="noteref-211" epub:type="noteref">211</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when y’ have hang’d the conjurer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y’ have time enough to deal with her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In th’ int’rim, spare for no trepans</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To draw her neck into the bans;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ply her with love-letters and billets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bait ’em well, for quirks and quillets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trains t’ inveigle and surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her heedless answers and replies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if she miss the mouse-trap lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ll serve for other by-designs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make an artist understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To copy out her seal, or hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or find void places in the paper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To steal in something to entrap her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, with her worldly goods and body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spite of her heart, she has endow’d ye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retain all sorts of witnesses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ply i’ th’ Temple under trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or walk the round, with knights o’ th’ posts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the cross-legg’d knights, their hosts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or wait for customers between</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pillars-rows in Lincoln’s Inn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where vouchers, forgers, common-bail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And affidavit-men, ne’er fail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ expose to sale all sorts of oaths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to their ears and clothes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their only necessary tools,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides the Gospel and their souls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when y’ are furnish’d with all purveys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall be ready at your service.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I would not give, quoth Hudibras,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A straw to understand a case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the admirable skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wind and manage it at will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To veer, and tack, and steer a cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the weather-gage of laws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ring the changes upon cases</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As plain as noses upon faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As you have well instructed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which you’ve earn’d (here ’tis) your fee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I long to practise your advice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And try the subtle artifice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bait a letter as you bid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As not long after thus he did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For having pump’d up all his wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And humm’d upon it, thus he writ:⁠—</span>
