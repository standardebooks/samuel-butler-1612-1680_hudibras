					<span>’Tis true, no lover has that pow’r</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ enforce a desperate amour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he that has two strings t’ his bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burns for love and money too;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For then he’s brave and resolute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disdains to render in his suit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has all his flames and raptures double,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hangs or drowns with half the trouble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While those who sillily pursue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The simple, downright way, and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make as unlucky applications,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steer against the stream their passions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some forge their mistresses of stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the ladies prove averse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more untoward to be won</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than by Caligula the moon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cry out upon the stars, for doing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill offices to cross their wooing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When only by themselves they’re hind’red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For trusting those they made her kindred;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still, the harsher and hide-bounder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The damsels prove, become the fonder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what mad lover ever dy’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gain a soft and gentle bride?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for a lady tender-hearted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In purling streams or hemp departed?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leap’d headlong int’ Elysium,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through th’ windows of a dazzling room?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for some cross, ill-natur’d dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The am’rous fly burnt in his flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This to the Knight could be no news,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all mankind so much in use;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who therefore took the wiser course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make the most of his amours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolv’d to try all sorts of ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As follows in due time and place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No sooner was the bloody fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the Wizard and the Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all th’ appurtenances, over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he relaps’d again t’ a lover;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he was always wont to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When h’ had discomfited a foe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And us’d the only antique philters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deriv’d from old heroic tilters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now triumphant, and victorious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He held th’ achievement was too glorious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such a conqueror to meddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With petty constable or beadle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fly for refuge to the hostess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ inns of court and chancery, Justice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who might, perhaps, reduce his cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To th’ ordeal trial of the laws;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where none escape, but such as branded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With red-hot irons have past bare-handed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if they cannot read one verse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ th’ Psalms, must sing it, and that’s worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He therefore judging it below him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tempt a shame the devil might owe him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolv’d to leave the Squire for bail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mainprize for him to the gaol,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To answer, with his vessel, all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That might disastrously befall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought it now the fittest juncture</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give the Lady a rencounter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ acquaint her with his expedition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And conquest o’er the fierce magician;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Describe the manner of the fray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And show the spoils he brought away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bloody scourging aggravate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The number of his blows, and weight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All which might probably succeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gain belief h’ had done the deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he resolv’d t’ enforce, and spare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No pawning of his soul to swear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, rather than produce his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To set his conscience on the rack;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in pursuance of his urging</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of articles perform’d and scourging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all things else, upon his part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Demand deliv’ry of her heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her goods and chattels, and good graces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And person, up to his embraces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thought he, the ancient errant knights</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Won all their ladies’ hearts in fights;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut whole giants into fritters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To put them into amorous twitters;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose stubborn bowels scorn’d to yield</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until their gallants were half kill’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when their bones were drub’d so sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They durst not woo one combat more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ladies’ hearts began to melt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Subdu’d by blows their lovers felt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So Spanish heroes, with their lances,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once wound bulls and ladies’ fancies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he acquires the noblest spouse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That widows greatest herds of cows:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then what may I expect to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wh’ have quell’d so vast a buffalo?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meanwhile, the Squire was on his way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Knight’s late orders to obey;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who sent him for a strong detachment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of beadles, constables, and watchmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ attack the cunning-man, for plunder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Committed falsely on his lumber;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he, who had so lately sack’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The enemy, had done the fact;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had rifled all his pokes and fobs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gimcracks, whims, and jiggumbobs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he, by hook or crook, had gather’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for his own inventions father’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they should, at gaol-delivery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unriddle one another’s thievery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both might have evidence enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To render neither halter-proof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought it desperate to tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And venture to be accessary;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather wisely slip his fetters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave them for the Knight, his betters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He call’d to mind th’ unjust, foul play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would have offer’d him that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make him curry his own hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which no beast ever did beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without all possible evasion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of the riding dispensation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore much about the hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Knight (for reasons told before)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolv’d to leave them to the fury</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of justice, and an unpack’d jury.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Squire concurr’d t’ abandon him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And serve him in the self-same trim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ acquaint the Lady what h’ had done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what he meant to carry on;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What project ’twas he went about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Sidrophel and he fell out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His firm and steadfast resolution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To swear her to an execution;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pawn his inward ears to marry her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-140" id="noteref-140" epub:type="noteref">140</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bribe the devil himself to carry her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which both dealt, as if they meant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their party-saints to represent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who never fail’d, upon their sharing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In any prosperous arms-bearing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lay themselves out to supplant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each other cousin German saint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, ere the Knight could do his part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Squire had got so much the start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>H’ had to the Lady done his errand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told her all his tricks aforehand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as he finish’d his report,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Knight alighted in the court;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having ty’d his beast t’ a pale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taking time for both to stale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put his band and beard in order,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sprucer to accost and board her:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now began t’ approach the door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she, wh’ had spy’d him out before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Convey’d th’ informer out of sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went to entertain the Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With whom encount’ring, after longees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of humble and submissive congees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all due ceremonies paid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He strok’d his beard, and thus he said:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Madam, I do, as is my duty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Honour the shadow of your shoe-tie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now am come to bring your ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A present you’ll be glad to hear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At least I hope so: the thing’s done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or may I never see the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which I humbly now demand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Performance at your gentle hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that you’d please to do your part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have done mine, to my smart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he shrugg’d his sturdy back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if he felt his shoulders ake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But she, who well enough knew what</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Before he spoke) he would be at,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pretended not to apprehend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystery of what he mean’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore wish’d him to expound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dark expressions less profound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Madam, quoth he, I come to prove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How much I’ve suffer’d for your love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which (like your votary) to win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have not spar’d my tatter’d skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for those meritorious lashes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To claim your favour and good graces.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth she, I do remember once</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I freed you from th’ enchanted sconce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that you promis’d, for that favour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bind your back to good behaviour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for my sake and service, vow’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lay upon’t a heavy load,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what ’twould bear t’ a scruple prove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As other knights do oft make love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, whether you have done or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Concerns yourself, not me, to know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if you have, I shall confess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y’ are honester than I could guess.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, If you suspect my troth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot prove it but by oath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if you make a question on’t,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll pawn my soul that I have done ’t;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he that makes his soul his surety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think, does give the best security.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth she, Some say, the soul’s secure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against distress and forfeiture;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is free from action, and exempt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From execution and contempt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to be summon’d to appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ other world’s illegal here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore few make any account</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Int’ what incumbrances they run ’t:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For most men carry things so even</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between this world, and hell, and heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the least offence to either,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They freely deal in all together;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And equally abhor to quit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world for both, or both for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they pawn and damn their souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are but pris’ners on paroles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For that (quoth he) ’tis rational</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may be accountable in all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when there is that intercourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between divine and human pow’rs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all that we determine here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commands obedience every where,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When penalties may be commuted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fines, or ears, and executed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It follows, nothing binds so fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As souls in pawn and mortgage past;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oaths are th’ only tests and seals</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of right and wrong, and true and false;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there’s no other way to try</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doubts of law and justice by.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth she, What is it you would swear?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s no believing till I hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, till they’re understood, all tales</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Like nonsense) are not true nor false.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, When I resolv’d t’ obey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you commanded th’ other day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to perform my exercise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As schools are wont) for your fair eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ avoid all scruples in the case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I went to do’t upon the place:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as the Castle is enchanted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Sidrophel, the witch, and haunted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With evil spirits, as you know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who took my Squire and me for two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before I’d hardly time to lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My weapons by, and disarray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard a formidable noise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loud as the Stentrophonic voice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-141" id="noteref-141" epub:type="noteref">141</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That roar’d far off, Dispatch and strip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m ready with the infernal whip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall divest thy ribs from skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To expiate thy ling’ring sin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ hast broken perfidiously thy oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not perform’d thy plighted troth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But spar’d thy renegado back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where th’ hadst so great a prize at stake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which now the fates have order’d me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For penance and revenge to flea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless thou presently make haste:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Time is, time was: And there it ceas’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which, though startled, I confess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet th’ horror of the thing was less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than th’ other dismal apprehension</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of interruption or prevention;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, snatching up the rod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I laid upon my back a load;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolv’d to spare no flesh and blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make my word and honour good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till tir’d, and making truce at length,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For new recruits of breath and strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I felt the blows still ply’d as fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As th’ had been by lovers plac’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-142" id="noteref-142" epub:type="noteref">142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In raptures of Platonic lashing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chaste contemplative bardashing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When facing hastily about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To stand upon my guard and scout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found th’ infernal cunning-man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And th’ under-witch, his Caliban,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With scourges (like the furies) arm’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on my outward quarters storm’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In haste I snatch’d my weapon up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave their hellish rage a stop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Call’d thrice upon your name, and fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Courageously on Sidrophel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who now transform’d himself t’ a bear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began to roar aloud, and tear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I as furiously press’d on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My weapon down his throat to run;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laid hold on him; but he broke loose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turn’d himself into a goose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Div’d under water, in a pond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hide himself from being found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain I sought him; but, as soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I perceiv’d him fled and gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prepar’d with equal haste and rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His under-sorcerer t’ engage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But bravely scorning to defile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sword with feeble blood and vile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I judg’d it better from a quick-</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Set hedge to cut a knotted stick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which I furiously laid on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till in a harsh and doleful tone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It roar’d, O hold for pity, Sir:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am too great a sufferer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abus’d, as you have been, b’ a witch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But conjur’d into a worse caprich;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who sends me out on many a jaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old houses in the night to haunt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For opportunities t’ improve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Designs of thievery or love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With drugs convey’d in drink or meat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All feats of witches counterfeit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kill pigs and geese with powder’d glass,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>And, sillier than the antic fools,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take treasure for a heap of coals;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek out for plants with signatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To quack of universal cures;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With figures ground on panes of glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make people on their heads to pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mighty heaps of coin increase,</span>

					<span>Reflected from a single piece,</span>

					<span>To draw in fools, whose nat’ral itches</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And danger of my neck and ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When less delinquents have been scourg’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hemp on wooden anvil forg’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which others for cravats have worn</span>

					<span>About their necks and took a turn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I pity’d the sad punishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wretched caitiff underwent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left my drubbing of his bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too great an honour for poltroons;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For knights are bound to feel no blows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From paltry and unequal foes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, when they slash, and cut to pieces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do all with civilest addresses:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their horses never give a blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when they make a leg, and bow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I therefore spar’d his flesh, and prest him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the witch with many a question.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, For many years he drove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A kind of broking-trade in love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Employ’d in all th’ intrigues and trust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of feeble, speculative lust:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Procurer to th’ extravagancy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crazy ribaldry of fancy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By those the devil had forsook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As things below him to provoke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But b’ing a virtuoso, able</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To smatter, quack, and cant, and dabble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He held his talent most adroit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any mystical exploit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As others of his tribe had done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rais’d their prices three to one:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For one predicting pimp has th’ odds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chaldrons of plain downright bawds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as an elf (the devil’s valet)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not so slight a thing to get;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For those that do his bus’ness best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hell are us’d the ruggedest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before so meriting a person</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cou’d get a grant, but in reversion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He serv’d two ’prenticeships, and longer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ th’ myst’ry of a lady-monger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For (as some write) a witch’s ghost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as from the body loos’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Becomes a puny imp itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is another witch’s elf:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He, after searching far and near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At length found one in Lancashire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With whom he bargain’d before-hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after hanging, entertain’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since which h’ has play’d a thousand feats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And practis’d all mechanic cheats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transform’d himself to th’ ugly shapes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wolves and bears, baboons and apes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he has vary’d more than witches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Pharaoh’s wizards, could their switches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all with whom he has to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn’d to as monstrous figures too:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness myself, whom h’ has abus’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to this beastly shape reduc’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By feeding me on beans and peas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He crams in nasty crevices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turns to comfits by his arts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make me relish for deserts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one by one, with shame and fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lick up the candy’d provender.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside⁠—But as he was running on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell what other feats h’ had done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady stopt his full career,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told him now ’twas time to hear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If half those things (said she) be true⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’re all, (quoth he,) I swear by you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why then (said she,) that Sidrophel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has damn’d himself to th’ pit of hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, mounted on a broom, the nag</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hackney of a Lapland hag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In quest of you came hither post,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within an hour (I’m sure) at most;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who told me all you swear and say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quite contrary another way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vow’d that you came to him to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you should carry me or no;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And would have hir’d him, and his imps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be your match-makers and pimps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ engage the devil on your side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steal (like Proserpine) your bride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he disdaining to embrace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So filthy a design and base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You fell to vapouring and huffing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drew upon him like a ruffian;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surpriz’d him meanly, unprepar’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before h’ had time to mount his guard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left him dead upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many a bruise and desperate wound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swore you had broke and robb’d his house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stole his talismanique louse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his new-found old inventions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With flat felonious intentions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he could bring out where he had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what he bought them for, and paid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His flea, his morpion, and punaise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>H’ had gotten for his proper ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all in perfect minutes made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By th’ ablest artists of the trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which (he could prove it) since he lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has been eaten up almost;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all together might amount</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To many hundreds on account;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which h’ had got sufficient warrant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seize the malefactors errant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without capacity of bail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of a cart’s or horse’s tail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did not doubt to bring the wretches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To serve for pendulums to watches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which modern virtuosos say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Incline to hanging every way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside, he swore, and swore ’twas true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, e’re he went in quest of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He set a figure to discover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you were fled to Rye or Dover;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found it clear, that, to betray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yourselves and me, you fled this way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that he was upon pursuit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take you somewhere hereabout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He vow’d he had intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all that past before and since;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found, that ere you came to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y’ had been engaging life and limb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About a case of tender conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where both abounded in your own sense;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Ralpho, by his light and grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had clear’d all scruples in the case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prov’d that you might swear and own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever’s by the wicked done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, most basely to requite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The service of his gifts and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You strove t’ oblige him, by main force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To scourge his ribs instead of yours;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that he stood upon his guard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all your vapouring out-dar’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, between you both, the feat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has never been perform’d as yet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While thus the Lady talk’d, the Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn’d th’ outside of his eyes to white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As men of inward light are wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To turn their optics in upon ’t)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wonder’d how she came to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What he had done and meant to do;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Held up his affidavit hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if h’ had been to be arraign’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast t’wards the door a ghastly look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In dread of Sidrophel, and spoke:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Madam, if but one word be true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the wizard has told you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or but one single circumstance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all th’ apocryphal romance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May dreadful earthquakes swallow down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This vessel, that is all your own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or may the heavens fall, and cover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These reliques of your constant lover.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You have provided well, quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I thank you) for yourself and me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shown your Presbyterian wits</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jump punctual with the Jesuits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A most compendious way, and civil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once to cheat the world, the devil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heaven and hell, yourselves, and those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On whom you vainly think t’ impose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why then (quoth he) may hell surprise⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That trick (said she) will not pass twice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve learn’d how far I’m to believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your pinning oaths upon your sleeve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there’s a better way of clearing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you would prove than downright swearing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if you have perform’d the feat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blows are visible as yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough to serve for satisfaction</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nicest scruples in the action:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if you can produce those knobs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although they’re but the witch’s drubs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll pass them all upon account,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if your natural self had done ’t;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Provided that they pass th’ opinion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of able juries of old women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, us’d to judge all matter of facts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For bellies, may do so for backs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Madam, (quoth he) your love’s a million;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do is less than to be willing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I am, were it in my power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ obey, what you command, and more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for performing what you bid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thank you ’s much as if I did.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You know I ought to have a care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep my wounds from taking air:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wounds in those that are all heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are dangerous in any part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I find (quoth she) my goods and chattels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are like to prove but mere drawn battels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For still the longer we contend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are but farther off the end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But granting now we should agree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is it you expect from me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your plighted faith (quoth he) and word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You past in heaven on record,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where all contracts, to have and t’ hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are everlastingly enroll’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if ’tis counted treason here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To raze records, ’tis much more there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth she, There are no bargains driv’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or marriages clapp’d up in heav’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that’s the reason, as some guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no heav’n in marriages;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two things that naturally press</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too narrowly to be at ease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bus’ness there is only love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which marriage is not like t’ improve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love, that’s too generous to abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be against its nature ty’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or where ’tis of itself inclin’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It breaks loose when it is confin’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like the soul, its harbourer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Debarr’d the freedom of the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disdains against its will to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But struggles out, and flies away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore never can comply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ endure the matrimonial tie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That binds the female and the male,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where th’ one is but the other’s bail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Roman gaolers, when they slept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chain’d to the prisoners they kept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the true and faithfull’st lover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gives best security to suffer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marriage is but a beast, some say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That carries double in foul way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore ’tis not to b’ admir’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It should so suddenly be tir’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bargain at a venture made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between two partners in a trade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For what’s inferr’d by t’ have and t’ hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But something past away, and sold?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as it makes but one of two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reduces all things else as low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, at the best, is but a mart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the one and th’ other part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on the marriage-day is paid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or hour of death, the bet is laid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the rest of better or worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both are but losers out of purse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when upon their ungot heirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ entail themselves, and all that’s theirs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What blinder bargain e’er was driv’n,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or wager laid at six and seven?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pass themselves away, and turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their children’s tenants e’re they’re born?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beg one another idiot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To guardians, ere they are begot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ever shall, perhaps, by th’ one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who’s bound to vouch ’em for his own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though got b’ implicit generation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gen’ral club of all the nation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which she’s fortify’d no less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than all the island, with four seas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exacts the tribute of her dower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In ready insolence and power;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And makes him pass away, to have</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hold, to her, himself, her slave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More wretched than an ancient villain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-145" id="noteref-145" epub:type="noteref">145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condemn’d to drudgery and tilling;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While all he does upon the by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is not bound to justify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor at her proper cost and charge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maintain the feats he does at large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such hideous sots were those obedient</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old vassals to their ladies regent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give the cheats the eldest hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In foul play by the laws o’ th’ land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which so many a legal cuckold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has been run down in courts and truckled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A law that most unjustly yokes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All Johns of Stiles to Joans of Noakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without distinction of degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condition, age, or quality:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Admits no power of revocation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor valuable consideration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor writ of error, nor reverse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of judgment past, for better or worse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not allow the privileges</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That beggars challenge under hedges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, when they’re griev’d, can make dead horses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their spiritual judges of divorces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While nothing else but Rem in Re</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can set the proudest wretches free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A slavery beyond enduring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that ’tis of their own procuring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As spiders never seek the fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But leave him, of himself, t’ apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So men are by themselves employ’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To quit the freedom they enjoy’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And run their necks into a noose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’d break ’em after to break loose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As some, whom death would not depart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have done the feat themselves by art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Indian widows, gone to bed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In flaming curtains to the dead;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-146" id="noteref-146" epub:type="noteref">146</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And men as often dangled for’t,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet will never leave the sport.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor do the ladies want excuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the stratagems they use</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gain th’ advantage of the set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lurch the amorous rook and cheat:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as the Pythagorean soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Runs through all beasts, and fish, and fowl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-147" id="noteref-147" epub:type="noteref">147</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And has a smack of ev’ry one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So love does, and has ever done;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, though ’tis ne’er so fond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Takes strangely to the vagabond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis but an ague that’s reverst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose hot fit takes the patient first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That after burns with cold as much</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ir’n in Greenland does the touch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Melts in the furnace of desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like glass, that’s but the ice of fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when his heat of fancy’s over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Becomes as hard and frail a lover:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when he’s with love-powder laden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prim’d and cock’d by Miss or Madam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smallest sparkle of an eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gives fire to his artillery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And off the loud oaths go; but, while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’re in the very act, recoil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence ’tis so few dare take their chance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without a sep’rate maintenance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And widows, who have try’d one lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trust none again, ’till th’ have made over;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if they do, before they marry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foxes weigh the geese they carry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere they venture o’er a stream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Know how to size themselves and them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence wittiest ladies always choose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To undertake the heaviest goose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For now the world is grown so wary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That few of either sex dare marry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather trust on tick t’ amours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cross and pile for better or worse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mode that is held honourable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well as French, and fashionable;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when it falls out for the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where both are incommoded least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In soul and body two unite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make up one hermaphrodite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still amorous, and fond, and billing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Philip and Mary on a shilling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ have more punctilios and capriches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the petticoat and breeches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More petulant extravagances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than poets make ’em in romances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though when their heroes ’spouse the dames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We hear no more of charms and flames:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For then their late attracts decline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turn as eager as prick’d wine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their catterwauling tricks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In earnest to as jealous piques:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which the ancients wisely signify’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By th’ yellow mantuas of the bride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For jealousy is but a kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of clap and grincam of the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The natural effects of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As other flames and aches do prove;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all the mischief is the doubt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On whose account they first broke out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though Chineses go to bed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-148" id="noteref-148" epub:type="noteref">148</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lie in, in their ladies’ stead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for the pains they took before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are nurs’d and pamper’d to do more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our green-men do it worse, when th’ hap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fail in labour of a clap:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both lay the child to one another;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who’s the father, who the mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis hard to say in multitudes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or who imported the French goods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But health and sickness b’ing all one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which both engag’d before to own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And are not with their bodies bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To worship only when they’re sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both give and take their equal shares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all they suffer by false wares;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fate no lover can divert</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all his caution, wit, and art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ’tis in vain to think to guess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At women by appearances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That paint and patch their imperfections</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of intellectual complexions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And daub their tempers o’er with washes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As artificial as their faces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wear under vizard-masks their talents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mother-wits before their gallants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until they’re hamper’d in the noose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too fast to dream of breaking loose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all the flaws they strove to hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are made unready with the bride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with her wedding-clothes undresses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her complaisance and gentilesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tries all her arts to take upon her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The government from th’ easy owner;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the wretch is glad to waive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lawful right, and turn her slave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find all his having and his holding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reduc’d t’ eternal noise and scolding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The conjugal petard that tears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down all portcullises of ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make the volley of one tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all their leathern shields too strong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When only arm’d with noise and nails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The female silk-worms ride the males,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transform ’em into rams and goats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Sirens, with their charming notes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-149" id="noteref-149" epub:type="noteref">149</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet as a screech-owl’s serenade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or those enchanting murmurs made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By th’ husband mandrake and the wife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-150" id="noteref-150" epub:type="noteref">150</a></span>

					<span>Both bury’d (like themselves) alive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, These reasons are but strains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wanton, overheated brains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which ralliers, in their wit, or drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do rather wheedle with than think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man was not man in paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until he was created twice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had his better half, his bride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Carv’d from the original, his side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ amend his natural defects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And perfect his recruiting sex;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enlarge his breed at once, and lessen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pains and labour of increasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By changing them for other cares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by his dry’d up paps appears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His body, that stupendous frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the world the anagram,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is of two equal parts compact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In shape and symmetry exact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the left and female side</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is to the manly right a bride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both join’d together with such art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That nothing else but death can part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those heav’nly attracts of yours, your eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And face, that all the world surprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dazzle all that look upon ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scorch all other ladies tawny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those ravishing and charming graces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are all made up of two half faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in a mathematic line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like those in other heavens, join,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which if either grew alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twould fright as much to look upon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so would that sweet bud your lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the other’s fellowship.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our noblest senses act by pairs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two eyes to see; to hear, two ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ intelligencers of the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wait upon the soul design’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But those that serve the body alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are single, and confin’d to one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world is but two parts, that meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And close at th’ equinoctial fit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-151" id="noteref-151" epub:type="noteref">151</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so are all the works of Nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stamp’d with her signature on matter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which all her creatures, to a leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or smallest blade of grass, receive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All which sufficiently declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How entirely marriage is her care⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The only method that she uses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the wonders she produces:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those that take their rules from her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can never be deceiv’d nor err.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what secures the civil life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But pawns of children, and a wife?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lie like hostages at stake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pay for all men undertake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom it is as necessary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to be born and breathe, and marry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So universal, all mankind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In nothing else is of one mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in what stupid age, or nation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was marriage ever out of fashion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless among the Amazons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-152" id="noteref-152" epub:type="noteref">152</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or cloister’d friars, and vestal nuns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Stoick, who, to bar the freaks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loose excesses of the sex,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prepost’rously would have all women</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn’d up to all the world in common.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though men would find such mortal feuds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sharing of their public goods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twould put them to more charge of lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than they’re supply’d with now by wives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until they graze, and wear their clothes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As beasts do, of their native growths:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For simple wearing of their horns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not suffice to serve their turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what can we pretend to inherit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless the marriage-deed will bear it?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could claim no right to lands or rents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for our parents’ settlements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had been but younger sons o’ th’ earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Debarr’d it all, but for our birth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What honours, or estates of peers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could be preserv’d but by their heirs?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what security maintains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their right and title, but the bans?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What crowns could be hereditary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If greatest monarchs did not marry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with their consorts consummate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their weightiest interests of state?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the amours of princes are</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But guarantees of peace or war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or what but marriage has a charm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rage of empires to disarm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make blood and desolation cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fire and sword unite in peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all their fierce contest for forage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conclude in articles of marriage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor does the genial bed provide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less for the int’rests of the bride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who else had not the least pretence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ as much as due benevolence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could no more title take upon her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To virtue, quality, and honour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than ladies-errant unconfin’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feme-coverts t’ all mankind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All women would be of one piece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The virtuous matron and the miss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nymphs of chaste Diana’s train,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-153" id="noteref-153" epub:type="noteref">153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same with those in Lewkner’s Lane,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-154" id="noteref-154" epub:type="noteref">154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the difference marriage makes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt wives and ladies of the lakes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides the joys of place and birth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sex’s paradise on earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A privilege so sacred held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none will to their mothers yield;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather than not go before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abandon heaven at the door.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if th’ indulgent law allows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A greater freedom to the spouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The reason is, because the wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Runs greater hazards of her life;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is trusted with the form and matter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all mankind by careful Nature:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where man brings nothing but the stuff</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She frames the wondrous fabric of;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who therefore, in a strait, may freely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Demand the clergy of her belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make it save her the same way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seldom misses to betray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless both parties wisely enter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the liturgy indenture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though some fits of small contest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes fall out among the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is no more than ev’ry lover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does from his hackney-lady suffer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That makes no breach of faith and love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather (sometimes) serves t’ improve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as, in running, ev’ry pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is but between two legs a race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which both do their uttermost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To get before, and win the post,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet when they’re at their race’s ends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’re still as kind and constant friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, to relieve their weariness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By turns give one another ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So all those false alarms of strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the husband and the wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And little quarrels, often prove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be but new recruits of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When those wh’ are always kind or coy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In time must either tire or cloy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor are their loudest clamours more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than as they’re relish’d, sweet or sour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like music, that proves bad or good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>According as ’tis understood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all amours, a lover burns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With frowns as well as smiles by turns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hearts have been as oft with sullen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As charming looks surpris’d and stolen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then why should more bewitching clamour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some lovers not as much enamour?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For discords make the sweetest airs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And curses are a kind of prayers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too slight alloys for all those grand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felicities by marriage gain’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For nothing else has pow’r to settle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ interests of love perpetual;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An act and deed, that makes one heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Becomes another’s counterpart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And passes fines on faith and love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inroll’d and register’d above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seal the slippery knots of vows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which nothing else but death can loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what security’s too strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To guard that gentle heart from wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to its friend is glad to pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itself away, and all it has;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, like an anchorite, gives over</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world for th’ heaven of a lover?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I grant (quoth she) there are some few</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who take that course, and find it true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But millions whom the same does sentence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To heav’n b’ another way⁠—repentance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love’s arrows are but shot at rovers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though all they hit they turn to lovers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the weighty consequents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Depend upon more blind events</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than gamesters, when they play a set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With greatest cunning at piquet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put out with caution, but take in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They know not what, unsight, unseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what do lovers, when they’re fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In one another’s arms embrac’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But strive to plunder, and convey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each other, like a prize, away?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To change the property of selves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sucking children are by elves?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if they use their persons so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What will they to their fortunes do?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their fortunes! the perpetual aims</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all their ecstasies and flames.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when the money’s on the book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, All my worldly goods⁠—but spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The formal livery and seisin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That puts a lover in possession,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that alone the bridegroom’s wedded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bride a flam that’s superseded:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that their faith is still made good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the oaths to us they vow’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when we once resign our pow’rs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>W’ have nothing left we can call ours:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our money’s now become the Miss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all your lives and services;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we forsaken, and postpon’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But bawds to what before we own’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, as it made y’ at first gallant us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So now hires others to supplant us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until ’tis all turn’d out of doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As we had been) for new amours:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what did ever heiress yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By being born to lordships get?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the more lady sh’ is of manors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s but expos’d to more trepanners,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pays for their projects and designs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for her own destruction fines;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And does but tempt them with her riches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To use her as the dev’l does witches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who takes it for a special grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be their cully for a space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when the time’s expir’d, the drazels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever may become his vassals:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So she, bewitch’d by rooks and spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betrays herself and all sh’ inherits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is bought and sold like stolen goods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By pimps, and match-makers, and bawds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until they force her to convey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steal the thief himself away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are the everlasting fruits</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all your passionate love-suits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ effects of all your amorous fancies</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Strive who shall be the ablest man</span>

					<span>At right gallanting of a fan;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>At sucking of a vizard-head;</span>

					<span>How best t’ accost us in all quarters,</span>

					<br/>

					<span>How debts and mortgages enchant!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What graces must that lady have</span>

					<span>These are the highest excellencies</span>

					<span>Of all your true or false pretences;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you would damn yourselves, and swear</span>

					<span>As much t’ an hostess dowager,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grown fat and pursy by retail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pots of beer and bottled ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And find her fitter for your turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fat is wondrous apt to burn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who at your flames would soon take fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Relent, and melt to your desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a candle in the socket,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dissolve her graces int’ your pocket.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this time ’twas grown dark and late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they heard a knocking at the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laid on in haste with such a powder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blows grew louder still and louder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which Hudibras, as if th’ had been</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bestow’d as freely on his skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expounding, by his inward light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or rather more prophetic fright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be the wizard, come to search,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take him napping in the lurch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn’d pale as ashes, or a clout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why or wherefore is a doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For men will tremble, and turn paler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With too much or too little valour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His heart laid on, as if it try’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To force a passage through his side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Impatient (as he vow’d) to wait ’em,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in a fury to fly at ’em;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore beat, and laid about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find a cranny to creep out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she, who saw in what a taking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Knight was by his furious quaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Undaunted cry’d, Courage, Sir Knight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Know, I’m resolv’d to break no rite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of hospitality t’ a stranger;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, to secure you out of danger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will here myself stand sentinel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To guard this pass ’gainst Sidrophel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Women, you know, do seldom fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make the stoutest men turn tail:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bravely scorn to turn their backs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the desp’ratest attacks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this the Knight grew resolute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Ironside and Hardiknute:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fortitude began to rally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out he cry’d aloud to sally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she besought him to convey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His courage rather out o’ th’ way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lodge in ambush on the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fortify’d behind a door;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if the enemy should enter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He might relieve her in th’ adventure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meanwhile they knock’d against the door</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fierce as at the gate before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which made the renegado Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Relapse again t’ his former fright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought it desperate to stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till th’ enemy had forc’d his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather post himself, to serve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady, for a fresh reserve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His duty was not to dispute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what sh’ had order’d execute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he resolv’d in haste t’ obey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore stoutly march’d away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all h’ encounter’d fell upon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though in the dark, and all alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till fear, that braver feats performs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than ever courage dar’d in arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had drawn him up before a pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To stand upon his guard and face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This he courageously invaded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having enter’d, barricado’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insconc’d himself as formidable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As could be underneath a table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he lay down in ambush close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ expect th’ arrival of his foes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Few minutes he had lain perdue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To guard his desp’rate avenue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before he heard a dreadful shout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As loud as putting to the rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which impatiently alarm’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fancy’d th’ enemy had storm’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after ent’ring, Sidrophel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was fall’n upon the guards pell-mell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He therefore sent out all his senses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bring him in intelligences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which vulgars out of ignorance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mistake for falling in a trance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But those that trade in geomancy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affirm to be the strength of fancy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which the Lapland Magi deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And things incredible reveal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile the foe beat up his quarters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And storm’d the out-works of his fortress:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as another of the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Degree and party, in arms and fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the same cause had engag’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At war with equal conduct wag’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By vent’ring only but to thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His head a span beyond his post,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>B’ a gen’ral of the cavaliers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was dragg’d thro’ a window by the ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he was serv’d in his redoubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the other end pull’d out.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon as they had him at their mercy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They put him to the cudgel fiercely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if they’d scorn to trade or barter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By giving or by taking quarter:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stoutly on his quarters laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until his scouts came in t’ his aid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when a man is past his sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s no way to reduce him thence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But twinging him by th’ ears or nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or laying on of heavy blows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that will not do the deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To burning with hot irons proceed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-158" id="noteref-158" epub:type="noteref">158</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner was he come t’ himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But on his neck a sturdy elf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clapp’d, in a trice, his cloven hoof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus attack’d him with reproof:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mortal, thou art betray’d to us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>B’ our friend, thy Evil Genius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, for thy horrid perjuries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy breach of faith, and turning lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brethren’s privilege (against</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wicked) on themselves, the saints,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has here thy wretched carcass sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For just revenge and punishment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which thou hast now no way to lessen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by an open free confession;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if we catch thee failing once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twill fall the heavier on thy bones.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What made thee venture to betray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And filch the lady’s heart away?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To spirit her to matrimony?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which contracts all matches⁠—money.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was th’ enchantment of her riches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made m’ apply t’ your crony witches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, in return, would pay th’ expense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wear and tear of conscience;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I could have patch’d up, and turn’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For th’ hundredth part of what I earn’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Didst thou not love her then? Speak true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more (quoth he) than I love you.⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How would’st th’ have us’d her, and her money?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First turn’d her up to alimony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid her dowry out in law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To null her jointure with a flaw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I before-hand had agreed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ have put, on purpose in the deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bar her widow’s making over</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ a friend in trust, or private lover.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What made thee pick and choose her out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ employ their sorceries about?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which makes gamesters play with those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who have least wit, and most to lose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But didst thou scourge thy vessel thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thou hast damn’d thyself to us?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see you take me for an ass:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis true, I thought the trick would pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a woman well enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ’t has been often found by proof;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose humours are not to be won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when they are impos’d upon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For love approves of all they do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That stand for candidates, and woo.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why didst thou forge those shameful lies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of bears and witches in disguise?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That is no more than authors give</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rabble credit to believe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A trick of following their leaders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To entertain their gentle readers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we have now no other way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of passing all we do or say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, when ’tis natural and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will be believ’d b’ a very few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside the danger of offence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fatal enemy of sense.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why did thou choose that cursed sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hypocrisy, to set up in?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Because it is in the thriving’st calling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The only saint-bell that rings all in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which all churches are concern’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is the easiest to be learn’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no degrees, unless they employ ’t,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can ever gain much, or enjoy ’t:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gift that is not only able</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To domineer among the rabble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by the laws impower’d to rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And awe the greatest that stand out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which few hold forth against, for fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their hands should slip, and come too near;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no sin else among the saints</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is taught so tenderly against.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What made thee break thy plighted vows?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which makes others break a house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hang, and scorn ye all, before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endure the plague of being poor.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, I see you have more tricks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than all your doating politics,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That are grown old, and out of fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compar’d with your New Reformation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we must come to school to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To learn your more refin’d and new.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, If you will give me leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell you what I now perceive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll find yourself an arrant chouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If y’ were but at a meeting-house.⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Tis true, quoth he, we ne’er come there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, w’ have let ’em out by th’ year.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Truly, quoth he, you can’t imagine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What wond’rous things they will engage in:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as your fellow-fiends in hell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were angels all before they fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So are you like to be agen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compar’d with th’ angels of us men.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, I am resolv’d to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy scholar in this mystery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore first desire to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some principles on which you go.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes a knave a child of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of us?⁠—A livelihood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What renders beating out of brains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And murder, godliness?⁠—Great gains.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What’s tender conscience?⁠—’Tis a botch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will not bear the gentlest touch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But breaking out, dispatches more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than th’ epidemical’st plague-sore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes y’ encroach upon our trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And damn all others?⁠—To be paid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What’s orthodox, and true, believing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against a conscience?⁠—A good living.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes rebelling against Kings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A good old cause?⁠—Administ’rings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes old doctrines plain and clear?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About two hundred pounds a year.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that which was prov’d true before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prove false again?⁠—Two hundred more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes the breaking of all oaths</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A holy duty?⁠—Food and clothes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What laws and freedom, persecution?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>B’ing out of pow’r, and contribution.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes a church a den of thieves?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dean and chapter, and white sleeves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ad what would serve, if those were gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make it orthodox?⁠—Our own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What makes morality a crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The most notorious of the time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Morality, which both the Saints,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wicked too, cry out against?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cause grace and virtue are within</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prohibited degrees of kin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore no true saint allows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall be suffer’d to espouse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For saints can need no conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with morality dispense;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As virtue’s impious, when ’tis rooted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In nature only, and not imputed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why the wicked should do so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We neither know, or care to do.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What’s liberty of conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ th’ natural and genuine sense?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis to restore, with more security,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rebellion to its ancient purity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Christian liberty reduce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To th’ elder practice of the Jews.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a large conscience is all one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And signifies the same with none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is enough (quoth he) for once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And has repriev’d thy forfeit bones:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nick Machiavel had ne’er a trick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Though he gave his name to our Old Nick,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But was below the least of these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That pass i’ th’ world for holiness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This said, the furies and the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ instant vanish’d out of sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left him in the dark alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With stinks of brimstone and his own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Queen of Night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-159" id="noteref-159" epub:type="noteref">159</a> whose large command</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rules all the sea, and half the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And over moist and crazy brains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In high spring-tides, at midnight reigns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was now declining to the west,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To go to bed, and take her rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Hudibras, whose stubborn blows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deny’d his bones that soft repose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay still expecting worse and more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stretch’d out at length upon the floor:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though he shut his eyes as fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if he’d been to sleep his last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw all the shapes that fear or wizards</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do make the devil wear for vizards;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pricking up his ears, to hark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he could hear too in the dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was first invaded with a groan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after, in a feeble tone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These trembling words: Unhappy wretch!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What hast thou gotten by this fetch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all thy tricks, in this new trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy holy brotherhood o’ th’ blade?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By saunt’ring still on some adventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And growing to thy horse a Centaur?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-160" id="noteref-160" epub:type="noteref">160</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To stuff thy skin with swelling knobs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of cruel and hard-wooded drubs?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For still th’ hast had the worst on’t yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well in conquest as defeat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Night is the sabbath of mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rest the body and the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which now thou art deny’d to keep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cure thy labour’d corpse with sleep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Knight, who heard the words, explain’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As meant to him this reprimand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the character did hit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Point-blank upon his case so fit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Believ’d it was some drolling sprite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That staid upon the guard that night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of those h’ had seen, and felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The drubs he had so freely dealt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, after a short pause and groan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doleful spirit thus went on:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This ’tis t’ engage with dogs and bears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pell-mell together by the ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after painful bangs and knocks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lie in limbo in the stocks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the pinnacle of glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fall headlong into purgatory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Thought he, this devil’s full of malice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in my late disasters rallies.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condemn’d to whipping, but declin’d it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By being more heroic minded:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at a riding handled worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With treats more slovenly and coarse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Engag’d with fiends in stubborn wars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hot disputes with conjurers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when th’ hadst bravely won the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wast fain to steal thyself away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I see, thought he, this shameless elf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wou’d fain steal me too from myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That impudently dares to own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I have suffer’d for and done.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now, but vent’ring to betray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast met with vengeance the same way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thought he, how does the devil know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ’twas that I design’d to do?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His office of intelligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His oracles, are ceas’d long since;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he knows nothing of the saints,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what some treacherous spy acquaints.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is some pettifogging fiend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some under door-keeper’s friend’s friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That undertakes to understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And juggles at the second-hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now would pass for Spirit Po,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all men’s dark concerns foreknow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think I need not fear him for’t;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These rallying devils do no hurt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With that he rous’d his drooping heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily cry’d out, What art?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wretch (quoth he) whom want of grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has brought to this unhappy place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do believe thee, quoth the Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus far I’m sure th’ art in the right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know what ’tis that troubles thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better than thou hast guess’d of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art some paltry, blackguard sprite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condemn’d to drudg’ry in the night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast no work to do in th’ house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor halfpenny to drop in shoes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the raising of which sum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You dare not be so troublesome</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pinch the slatterns black and blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For leaving you their work to do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is your bus’ness, good Pug-Robin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And your diversion dull dry-bobbing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ entice fanatics in the dirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wash them clean in ditches for’t;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which conceit you are so proud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At ev’ry jest you laugh aloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As now you would have done by me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that I barr’d your raillery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir (quoth the voice,) y’are no such Sophi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-161" id="noteref-161" epub:type="noteref">161</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As you would have the world judge of ye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you design to weigh our talents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ th’ standard of your own false balance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or think it possible to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us ghosts as well as we do you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We, who have been the everlasting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companions of your drubs and basting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never left you in contest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With male or female, man or beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But prov’d as true t’ ye, and entire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all adventures, as your Squire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quoth he, That may be said as true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By th’ idlest pug of all your crew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For none could have betray’d us worse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than those allies of ours and yours.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I have sent him for a token</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To your low-country Hogen-Mogen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whose infernal shores I hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’ll swing like skippers in a rope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if y’ have been more just to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As I am apt to think) than he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am afraid it is as true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What th’ ill-affected say of you:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y’ have spous’d the Covenant and Cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By holding up your cloven paws.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir, (quoth the voice,) ’tis true, I grant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We made and took the Covenant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that no more concerns the Cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than other perj’ries do the laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, when they’re prov’d in open court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wear wooden peccadillos for’t:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-162" id="noteref-162" epub:type="noteref">162</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that’s the reason Cov’nanters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hold up their hands, like rogues at bars.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see, quoth Hudibras, from whence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These scandals of the saints commence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That are but natural effects</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Satan’s malice, and his sects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those spider-saints, that hang by threads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spun out o’ th’ entrails of their heads.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir, (quoth the voice,) that may as true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And properly be said of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose talents may compare with either,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or both the other put together:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the Independents do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is only what you forc’d ’em to;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You, who are not content alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With tricks to put the devil down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But must have armies rais’d to back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gospel work you undertake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if artillery, and edge-tools,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were th’ only engines to save souls:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he, poor devil, has no pow’r</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By force to run down and devour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has ne’er a Classis; cannot sentence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To stools, or poundage of repentance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is ty’d up only to design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ entice, and tempt, and undermine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which you all his arts outdo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prove yourselves his betters too.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence ’tis possessions do less evil<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-163" id="noteref-163" epub:type="noteref">163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than mere temptations of the devil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which all the horrid’st actions done</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are charg’d in courts of law upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because unless they help the elf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can do little of himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore where he’s best possess’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Acts most against his interest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surprizes none, but those wh’ have priests</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To turn him out, and exorcists,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supply’d with spiritual provision,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And magazines of ammunition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crosses, relics, crucifixes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beads, pictures, rosaries, and pixes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tools of working our salvation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By mere mechanic operation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With holy water, like a sluice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To overflow all avenues:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But those wh’ are utterly unarm’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ oppose his entrance, if he storm’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He never offers to surprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although his falsest enemies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But is content to be their drudge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on their errands glad to trudge:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For where are all your forfeitures</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entrusted in safe hands, but ours?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who are but jailers of the holes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dungeons where you clap up souls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like under-keepers, turn the keys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’ your mittimus anathemas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never boggle to restore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The members you deliver o’re</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon demand, with fairer justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than all your covenanting Trustees;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless, to punish them the worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You put them in the secular pow’rs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pass their souls, as some demise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same estate in mortgage twice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When to a legal Utlegation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-164" id="noteref-164" epub:type="noteref">164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>You turn your excommunication,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for a groat unpaid, that’s due,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distrain on soul and body too.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-165" id="noteref-165" epub:type="noteref">165</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thought he, ’tis no mean part of civil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>State prudence to cajole the devil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not to handle him too rough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When h’ has us in his cloven hoof.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Tis true, quoth he, that intercourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has pass’d between your friends and ours;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as you trust us, in our way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To raise your members, and to lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We send you others of our own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Denounc’d to hang themselves or drown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, frighted with our oratory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To leap down headlong many a story;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have us’d all means to propagate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your mighty interests of state;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laid out our spiritual gifts to further</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your great designs of rage and murther.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if the saints are nam’d from blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We only have made that title good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it were but in our power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We should not scruple to do more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not be half a soul behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all dissenters of mankind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Right, quoth the voice, and as I scorn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be ungrateful, in return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all those kind good offices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll free you out of this distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set you down in safety, where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no time to tell you here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cock crows, and the morn grows on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When ’tis decreed I must be gone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I leave you here till day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll find it hard to get away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the spirit grop’d about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find th’ enchanted hero out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And try’d with haste to lift him up;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But found his forlorn hope, his crup,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unserviceable with kicks and blows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Receiv’d from harden’d-hearted foes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought to drag him by the heels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Gresham carts, with legs for wheels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fear, that soonest cures those sores</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In danger of relapse to worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came in t’ assist him with its aid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up his sinking vessel weigh’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner was he fit to trudge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But both made ready to dislodge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spirit hors’d him like a sack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the vehicle his back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bore him headlong into th’ hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With some few rubs against the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where finding out the postern lock’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And th’ avenues as strongly block’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>H’ attack’d the window, storm’d the glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a moment gain’d the pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thro’ which he dragg’d the worsted soldier’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fore-quarters out by the head and shoulders;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cautiously began to scout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find their fellow-cattle out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor was it half a minute’s quest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he retriev’d the champion’s beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ty’d to a pale, instead of rack;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’er a saddle on his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor pistols at the saddle-bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Convey’d away the Lord knows how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought it was no time to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let the night too steal away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in a trice advanc’d the Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the bare ridge, bolt upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And groping out for Ralpho’s jade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He found the saddle too was stray’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the place a lump of soap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he speedily leap’d up;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turning to the gate the rein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He kick’d and cudgell’d on amain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Hudibras, with equal haste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On both sides laid about as fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spurr’d as jockies use, to break,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or padders to secure, a neck;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where let us leave ’em for a time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to their churches turn our rhyme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hold forth their declining state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which now come near an even rate.</span>
