						<span>'Tis true, no lover has that pow'r</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' enforce a desperate amour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he that has two strings t' his bow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And burns for love and money too;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For then he's brave and resolute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disdains to render in his suit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has all his flames and raptures double,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hangs or drowns with half the trouble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While those who sillily pursue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The simple, downright way, and true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make as unlucky applications,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And steer against the stream their passions.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some forge their mistresses of stars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the ladies prove averse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more untoward to be won</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than by CALIGULA the Moon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry out upon the stars, for doing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ill offices to cross their wooing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When only by themselves they're hindred,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For trusting those they made her kindred;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still, the harsher and hide-bounder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The damsels prove, become the fonder.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what mad lover ever dy'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To gain a soft and gentle bride?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or for a lady tender-hearted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In purling streams or hemp departed?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leap'd headlong int' Elysium,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through th' windows of a dazzling room?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for some cross, ill-natur'd dame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The am'rous fly burnt in his flame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This to the Knight could be no news,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all mankind so much in use;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who therefore took the wiser course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the most of his amours,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolv'd to try all sorts of ways,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As follows in due time and place</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No sooner was the bloody fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the Wizard, and the Knight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all th' appurtenances, over,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But he relaps'd again t' a lover;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he was always wont to do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When h' had discomfited a foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And us'd the only antique philters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deriv'd from old heroic tilters.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now triumphant, and victorious,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He held th' atchievement was too glorious</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For such a conqueror to meddle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With petty constable or beadle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or fly for refuge to the Hostess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of th' Inns of Court and Chancery, Justice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who might, perhaps reduce his cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To th' ordeal trial of the laws,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where none escape, but such as branded</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With red-hot irons have past bare-handed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, if they cannot read one verse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I' th' Psalms, must sing it, and that's worse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He therefore judging it below him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tempt a shame the Devil might owe him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolv'd to leave the Squire for bail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mainprize for him to the gaol,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To answer, with his vessel, all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That might disastrously befall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thought it now the fittest juncture</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To give the Lady a rencounter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' acquaint her 'with his expedition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And conquest o'er the fierce Magician;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Describe the manner of the fray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And show the spoils he brought away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His bloody scourging aggravate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The number of his blows, and weight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All which might probably succeed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gain belief h' had done the deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which he resolv'd t' enforce, and spare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No pawning of his soul to swear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, rather than produce his back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set his conscience on the rack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in pursuance of his urging</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of articles perform'd and scourging,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all things else, his part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Demand deliv'ry of her heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her goods, and chattels, and good graces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And person up to his embraces.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thought he, the ancient errant knights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Won all their ladies hearts in fights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cut whole giants into fritters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To put them into amorous twitters</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose stubborn bowels scorn'd to yield</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until their gallants were half kill'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when their bones were drub'd so sore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They durst not woo one combat more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ladies hearts began to melt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Subdu'd by blows their lovers felt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Spanish heroes, with their lances,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once wound bulls and ladies' fancies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he acquires the noblest spouse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That widows greatest herds of cows:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then what may I expect to do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wh' have quell'd so vast a buffalo?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Mean while, the Squire was on his way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight's late orders to obey;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who sent him for a strong detachment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of beadles, constables, and watchmen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' attack the cunning-man fur plunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Committed falsely on his lumber;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he, who had so lately sack'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The enemy, had done the fact;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had rifled all his pokes and fobs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gimcracks, whims, and jiggumbobs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he, by hook or crook, had gather'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for his own inventions father'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they should, at gaol delivery,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unriddle one another's thievery,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both might have evidence enough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To render neither halter proof.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought it desperate to tarry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And venture to be accessary</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather wisely slip his fetters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leave them for the Knight, his betters.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He call'd to mind th' unjust, foul play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wou'd have offer'd him that day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make him curry his own hide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which no beast ever did beside,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without all possible evasion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But of the riding dispensation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore much about the hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight (for reasons told before)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolv'd to leave them to the fury</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Justice, and an unpack'd Jury,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Squire concurr'd t' abandon him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And serve him in the self-same trim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' acquaint the Lady what h' had done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what he meant to carry on;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What project 'twas he went about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When SIDROPHEL and he fell out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His firm and stedfast Resolution,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To swear her to an execution;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pawn his inward ears to marry her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bribe the Devil himself to carry her;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which both dealt, as if they meant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their Party-Saints to represent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who never fail'd upon their sharing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In any prosperous arms-bearing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lay themselves out to supplant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each other Cousin-German Saint.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, ere the Knight could do his part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Squire had got so much the start,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H' had to the Lady done his errand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And told her all his tricks afore-hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just as he finish'd his report,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight alighted in the court;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And having ty'd his beast t' a pale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And taking time for both to stale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He put his band and beard in order,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sprucer to accost and board her;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now began t' approach the door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When she, wh' had spy'd him out before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Convey'd th' informer out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And went to entertain the Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With whom encount'ring, after longees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of humble and submissive congees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all due ceremonies paid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strok'd his beard, and thus he said:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Madam, I do, as is my duty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honour the shadow of your shoe-tye;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now am come to bring your ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A present you'll be glad to hear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At least I hope so: the thing's done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or may I never see the sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which I humbly now demand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Performance at your gentle hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that you'd please to do your part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I have done mine, to my smart.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With that he shrugg'd his sturdy back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if he felt his shoulders ake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But she, who well enough knew what</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Before he spoke) he would be at,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pretended not to apprehend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mystery of what he mean'd;.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore wish'd him to expound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His dark expressions, less profound.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Madam, quoth he, I come to prove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How much I've suffer'd for your love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which (like your votary) to win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have not spar'd my tatter'd skin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for those meritorious lashes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To claim your favour and good graces.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth she, I do remember once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I freed you from th' inchanted sconce;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that you promis'd, for that favour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bind your back to good behaviour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for my sake and service, vow'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lay upon't a heavy load,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what 'twould bear t' a scruple prove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As other Knights do oft make love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, whether you have done or no,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Concerns yourself, not me, to know.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But if you have, I shall confess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Y' are honester than I could guess.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, if you suspect my troth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot prove it but by oath;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if you make a question on't,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'll pawn my soul that I have done't;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he that makes his soul his surety,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I think, does give the best security.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth she, Some say, the soul's secure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against distress and forfeiture</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is free from action, and exempt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From execution and contempt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to be summon'd to appear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In th' other world's illegal here;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore few make any account</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Int' what incumbrances they run't</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For most men carry things so even</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between this World, and Hell, and Heaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the least offence to either,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They freely deal in all together;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And equally abhor to quit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This world for both or both for it;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they pawn and damn their souls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are but pris'ners on paroles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For that (quoth he) 'tis rational,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' may be accountable in all:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when there is that intercourse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between divine and human pow'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all that we determine here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Commands obedience every where,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When penalties may be commuted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fines or ears, and executed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It follows, nothing binds so fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As souls in pawn and mortgage past</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For oaths are th' only tests and seals</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of right and wrong, and true and false,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there's no other way to try</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The doubts of law and justice by.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Quoth she) What is it you would swear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There's no believing till I hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, till they're understood all tales</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Like nonsense) are not true nor false.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Quoth he) When I resolv'd t' obey</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What you commanded th' other day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to perform my exercise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As schools are wont) for your fair eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' avoid all scruples in the case,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I went to do't upon the place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as the Castle is inchanted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By SIDROPHEL the Witch and haunted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By evil spirits, as you know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who took my Squire and me for two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before I'd hardly time to lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My weapons by, and disarray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I heard a formidable noise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loud as the Stentrophonick voice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-140" id="noteref-140" epub:type="noteref">140</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That roar'd far off, Dispatch and strip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'm ready with th' infernal whip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shall divest thy ribs from skin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To expiate thy ling'ring sin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' hast broken perfidiously thy oath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not perform'd thy plighted troth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But spar'd thy renegado back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where th' hadst so great a prize at stake;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which now the fates have order'd me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For penance and revenge to flea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless thou presently make haste:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Time is, time was: And there it ceas'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which, though startled, I confess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet th' horror of the thing was less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than th' other dismal apprehension</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of interruption or prevention;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore, snatching up the rod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I laid upon my back a load;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolv'd to spare no flesh and blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make my word and honour good;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till tir'd, and making truce at length,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For new recruits of breath and strength,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I felt the blows still ply'd as fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As th' had been by lovers plac'd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-141" id="noteref-141" epub:type="noteref">141</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In raptures of platonick lashing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And chaste contemplative bardashing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When facing hastily about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stand upon my guard and scout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I found th' infernal Cunning-man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And th' under-witch, his CALIBAN,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With scourges (like the Furies) arm'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That on my outward quarters storm'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In haste I snatch'd my weapon up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gave their hellish rage a stop;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Call'd thrice upon your name, and fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Courageously on SIDROPHEL;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, now transform'd himself a bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to roar aloud, and tear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When I as furiously press'd on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My weapon down his throat to run;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laid hold on him; but he broke loose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn'd himself into a goose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Div'd under water, in a pond,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hide himself from being found.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain I sought him; but, as soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I perceiv'd him fled and gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prepar'd with equal haste and rage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Under-sorcerer t' engage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But bravely scorning to defile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My sword with feeble blood and vile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I judg'd it better from a quick-</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set hedge to cut a knotted stick,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which I furiously laid on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, in a harsh and doleful tone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It roar'd, O hold for pity, Sir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I am too great a sufferer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abus'd, as you have been, b' a witch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But conjur'd into a worse caprich;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who sends me out on many a jaunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old houses in the night to haunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For opportunities t' improve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Designs of thievery or love;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With drugs convey'd in drink or meat,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>Too great an honour for pultrones;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Knights are bound to feel no blows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From paultry and unequal foes,</span>

						<span>Their horses never give a blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when they make a leg, and bow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I therefore spar'd his flesh, and prest him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the witch with many a. question.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, For many years he drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A kind of broking-trade in love;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Employ'd in all th' intrigues, and trust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of feeble, speculative lust:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Procurer to th' extravagancy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And crazy ribaldry of fancy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By those the Devil had forsook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As things below him to provoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But b'ing a virtuoso, able</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To smatter, quack, and cant, and dabble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He held his talent most adroit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For any mystical exploit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As others of his tribe had done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rais'd their prices three to one:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For one predicting pimp has th' odds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of chauldrons of plain downright bawds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as an elf (the Devil's valet)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is not so slight a thing to get;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For those that do his bus'ness best,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In hell are us'd the ruggedest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before so meriting a person</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou'd get a grant, but in reversion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He serv'd two prenticeships, and longer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I' th' myst'ry of a lady-monger.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For (as some write) a witch's ghost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As soon as from the body loos'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes a puney-imp itself</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is another witch's elf.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He, after searching far and near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length found one in LANCASHIRE</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With whom he bargain'd before-hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after hanging, entertained;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since which h' has play'd a thousand feats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And practis'd all mechanick cheats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transform'd himself to th' ugly shapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wolves and bears, baboons and apes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which he has vary'd more than witches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Pharaoh's wizards cou'd their switches;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all with whom h' has had to do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn'd to as monstrous figures too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Witness myself, whom h' has abus'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to this beastly shape reduc'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By feeding me on beans and pease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He crams in nasty crevices,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turns to comfits by his arts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make me relish for disserts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one by one, with shame and fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lick up the candy'd provender.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside — But as h' was running on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tell what other feats h' had done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Lady stopt his full career,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And told him now 'twas time to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If half those things (said she) be true —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They're all, (quoth he,) I swear by you.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why then (said she,) That SIDROPHEL</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has damn'd himself to th' pit of Hell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, mounted on a broom, the nag</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hackney of a Lapland hag,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In quest of you came hither post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within an hour (I'm sure) at most;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who told me all you swear and say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quite contrary another way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vow'd that you came to him to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If you should carry me or no;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And would have hir'd him, and his imps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be your match-makers and pimps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' engage the Devil on. your side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And steal (like PROSERPINE) your bride.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But he, disdaining to embrace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So filthy a design and base,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You fell to vapouring and huffing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drew upon him like a ruffin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surpriz'd him meanly, unprepar'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before h' had time to mount his guard;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left him dead upon the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many a bruise and desperate wound:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swore you had broke and robb'd his house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stole his talismanique louse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his new-found old inventions;.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With flat felonious intentions;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which he could bring out where he had,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what he bought them for, and paid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His flea, his morpion, and punese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H' had gotten for his proper ease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all perfect minutes made,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By th' ablest artist of the trade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which (he could prove it) since he lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He has been eaten up almost;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all together might amount</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To many hundreds on account;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which h' had got sufficient warrant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To seize the malefactors errant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without capacity of bail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But of a cart's or horse's tail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And did not doubt to bring the wretches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To serve for pendulums to watches;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, modern virtuosos say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Incline to hanging every way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside, he swore, and swore 'twas true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, e're he went in quest of you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He set a figure to discover</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If you were fled to RYE or DOVER;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And found it clear, that, to betray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yourselves and me, you fled this way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that he was upon pursuit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take you somewhere hereabout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He vow' d he had intelligence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all that past before and since;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And found that, e'er you came to him,.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Y' had been engaging life and limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a case of tender conscience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where both abounded in your own sense:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till RALPHO, by his light and grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had clear'd all scruples in the case;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prov'd that you might swear and own</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever's by the wicked done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which, most basely to requite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The service of his gifts and light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You strove to oblige him, by main force,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To scourge his ribs instead of yours;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that he stood upon his guard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all your vapouring out-dar'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which, between you both, the feat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has never been perform'd as yet.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>While thus the Lady talk'd, the Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn'd th' outside of his eyes to white;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As men of inward light are wont</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To turn their opticks in upon 't)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wonder'd how she came to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What he had done, and meant to do;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held up his affidavit-hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if h' had been to be arraign'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cast t'wards the door a look,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In dread of SIDROPHEL, and spoke:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Madam, if but one word be true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the Wizard has told you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or but one single circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all th' apocryphal romance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May dreadful earthquakes swallow down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This vessel, that is all your own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or may the heavens fall, and cover</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These reliques of your constant lover.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>You have provided well, quoth she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(I thank you) for yourself and me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shown your presbyterian wits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jump punctual with the Jesuits;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A most compendious way, and civil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once to cheat the world, the Devil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Heaven and Hell, yourselves, and those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On whom you vainly think t' impose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why then (quoth he) may Hell surprize —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That trick (said she) will not pass twice:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I've learn'd how far I'm to believe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your pinning oaths upon your sleeve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But there's a better way of clearing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What you would prove than downright swearing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if you have perform'd the feat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blows are visible as yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enough to serve for satisfaction</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of nicest scruples in the action:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if you can produce those knobs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although they're but the witch's drubs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'll pass them all upon account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if your natural self had done't</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provided that they pass th' opinion</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of able juries of old women</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, us'd to judge all matter of facts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For bellies, may do so for backs,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Madam, (quoth he,) your love's a million;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do is less than to be willing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I am, were it in my power,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' obey, what you command, and more:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for performing what you bid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I thank you as much as if I did.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You know I ought to have a care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To keep my wounds from taking air:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For wounds in those that are all heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are dangerous in any part.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I find (quoth she) my goods and chattels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are like to prove but mere drawn battels;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still the longer we contend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We are but farther off the end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But granting now we should agree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What is it you expect from me?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your plighted faith (quoth he) and word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You past in heaven on record,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where all contracts, to have and t' hold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are everlastingly enroll'd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if 'tis counted treason here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To raze records, 'tis much more there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quoth she, There are no bargains driv'n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or marriages clapp'd up, in Heav'n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that's the reason, as some guess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no heav'n in marriages;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two things that naturally press</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too narrowly to be at ease.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their bus'ness there is only love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which marriage is not like t' improve:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love, that's too generous to abide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be against its nature ty'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or where 'tis of itself inclin'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It breaks loose when it is confin'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like the soul, it's harbourer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Debarr'd the freedom of the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disdains against its will to stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But struggles out, and flies away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore never can comply</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To endure the matrimonial tie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That binds the female and the male,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where th' one is but the other's bail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Roman gaolers, when they slept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chain'd to the prisoners they kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the true and faithfull'st lover</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gives best security to suffer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Marriage is but a beast, some say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That carries double in foul way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore 'tis not to b' admir'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It should so suddenly be tir'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bargain at a venture made,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between two partners in a trade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For what's inferr'd by t' have and t' hold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But something past away, and sold?)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That as it makes but one of two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reduces all things else as low;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, at the best, is but a mart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the one and th' other part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That on the marriage-day is paid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or hour of death, the bet is laid;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the rest of better or worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both are but losers out of purse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when upon their ungot heirs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' entail themselves, and all that's theirs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What blinder bargain e'er was driv'n,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or wager laid at six and seven?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pass themselves away, and turn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their childrens' tenants e're they're born?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beg one another idiot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guardians, e'er they are begot;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or ever shall, perhaps, by th' one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who's bound to vouch 'em for his own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though got b' implicit generation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gen'ral club of all the nation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which she's fortify'd no less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all the island, with four seas;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exacts the tribute of her dower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>in ready insolence and power;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And makes him pass away to have</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hold, to her, himself, her slave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More wretched than an ancient villain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-144" id="noteref-144" epub:type="noteref">144</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condemn'd to drudgery and tilling;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While all he does upon the by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She is not bound to justify,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor at her proper cost and charge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Maintain the feats he does at large.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such hideous sots were those obedient</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old vassals to their ladies regent;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To give the cheats the eldest hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In foul play by the laws o' th' land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which so many a legal cuckold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has been run down in courts and truckeld:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A law that most unjustly yokes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All Johns of Stiles to Joans of Nokes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without distinction of degree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condition, age, or quality:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Admits no power of revocation,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Nor writ of error, nor reverse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Judgment past, for better or worse:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will not allow the priviledges</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That beggars challenge under hedges,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, when they're griev'd, can make dead horses</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their spiritual judges of divorces;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While nothing else but Rem in Re</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can set the proudest wretches free;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A slavery beyond enduring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that 'tis of their own procuring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As spiders never seek the fly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But leave him, of himself, t' apply</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So men are by themselves employ'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To quit the freedom they enjoy'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And run their necks into a noose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They'd break 'em after, to break loose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As some whom Death would not depart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have done the feat themselves by art;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Indian widows, gone to bed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In flaming curtains to the dead;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-145" id="noteref-145" epub:type="noteref">145</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>Takes strangely to the vagabond.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis but an ague that's reverst,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>That after burns with cold as much</span>

						<span>As ir'n in GREENLAND does the touch;</span>

						<span>And when his heat of fancy's over,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes as hard and frail a lover.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when he's with love-powder laden,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prim'd and cock'd by Miss or Madam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smallest sparkle of an eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gives fire to his artillery;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And off the loud oaths go; but while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They're in the very act, recoil.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hence 'tis so few dare take their chance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without a sep'rate maintenance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And widows, who have try'd one lover,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trust none again, 'till th' have made over;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or if they do, before they marry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foxes weigh the geese they carry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And e're they venture o'er a stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Know how to size themselves and them;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence wittiest ladies always choose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To undertake the heaviest goose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the world is grown so wary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That few of either sex dare marry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather trust on tick t' amours,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cross and pile for better or worse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mode that is held honourable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well as French, and fashionable:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when it falls out for the best,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where both are incommoded least,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In soul and body two unite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make up one hermaphrodite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still amorous, and fond, and billing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like PHILIP and MARY on a shilling,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' have more punctilios and capriches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the petticoat and breeches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More petulant extravagances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than poets make 'em in romances.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though when their heroes 'spouse the dames,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We hear no more charms and flames:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For then their late attracts decline,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn as eager as prick'd wine;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all their catterwauling tricks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In earnest to as jealous piques;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which the ancients wisely signify'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By th' yellow mantos of the bride:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For jealousy is but a kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of clap and grincam of the mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The natural effects of love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As other flames and aches prove;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all the mischief is, the doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On whose account they first broke out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though Chineses go to bed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-147" id="noteref-147" epub:type="noteref">147</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lie in, in their ladies stead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the pains they took before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are nurs'd and pamper'd to do more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our green men do it worse, when th' hap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fail in labour of a clap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both lay the child to one another:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But who's the father, who the mother,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis hard to say in multitudes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or who imported the French goods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But health and sickness b'ing all one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which both engag'd before to own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And are not with their bodies bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To worship, only when they're sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both give and take their equal shares</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all they suffer by false wares:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fate no lover can divert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all his caution, wit, and art.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For 'tis in vain to think to guess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At women by appearances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That paint and patch their imperfections</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of intellectual complexions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And daub their tempers o'er with washes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As artificial as their faces;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wear under vizard-masks their talents</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mother-wits before their gallants,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until they're hamper'd in the noose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too fast to dream of breaking loose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all the flaws they strove to hide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are made unready with the bride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with her wedding-clothes undresses</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her complaisance and gentilesses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tries all her arts to take upon her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The government from th' easy owner;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the wretch is glad to wave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His lawful right, and turn her slave;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Find all his having, and his holding,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reduc'd t' eternal noise and scolding;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The conjugal petard, that tears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down all portcullises of ears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make the volley of one tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all their leathern shields too strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When only arm'd with noise and nails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The female silk-worms ride the males,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transform 'em into rams and goats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Sirens, with their charming notes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-148" id="noteref-148" epub:type="noteref">148</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sweet as a screech-owl's serenade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or those enchanting murmurs made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By th' husband mandrake and the wife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-149" id="noteref-149" epub:type="noteref">149</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both bury'd (like themselves) alive.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, These reasons are but strains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wanton, over-heated brains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which ralliers, in their wit, or drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do rather wheedle with than think</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Man was not man in paradise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he was created twice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had his better half, his bride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Carv'd from the original, his side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' amend his natural defects,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And perfect his recruited sex;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inlarge his breed at once, and lessen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pains and labour of increasing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By changing them for other cares,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by his dry'd-up paps appears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His body, that stupendous frame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the world the anagram</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is of two equal parts compact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In shape and symmetry exact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the left and female side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is to the manly right a bride;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both join'd together with such art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nothing else but death can part.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those heav'nly attracts of yours, your eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And face, that all the world surprize,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dazzle all that look upon ye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scorch all other ladies tawny,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those ravishing and charming graces</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are all made up of two half faces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in a mathematick line,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like those in other heavens, join,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which if either grew alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' would fright as much to look upon:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so would that sweet bud your lip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the other's fellowship.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our noblest senses act by pairs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two eyes to see; to hear, two ears;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' intelligencers of the mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait upon the soul design'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But those that serve the body alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are single, and confin'd to one.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The world is but two parts, that meet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And close at th' equinoctial fit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-150" id="noteref-150" epub:type="noteref">150</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so are all the works of nature,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stamp'd with her signature on matter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which all her creatures, to a leaf,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or smallest blade of grass receive;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All which sufficiently declare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How entirely marriage is her care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only method that she uses</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the wonders she produces:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those that take their rules from her,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can never be deceiv'd, nor err.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what secures the civil life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But pawns of children, and a wife?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lie like hostages at stake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pay for all men undertake;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whom it is as necessary</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As to be born and breathe, to marry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So universal all mankind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In nothing else, is of one mind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For in what stupid age, or nation,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was marriage ever out of fashion?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless among the Amazons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-151" id="noteref-151" epub:type="noteref">151</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or cloister'd friars, and vestal nuns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Stoicks, who to bar the freaks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And loose excesses of the sex,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prepost'rously wou'd have all women</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn'd up to all the world in common.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though men would find such mortal feuds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sharing of their publick goods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twould put them to more charge of lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than they're supply'd with now by wives;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until they graze, and wear their clothes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As beasts do, of their native growths:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For simple wearing of their horns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will not suffice to serve their turns.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what can we pretend t' inherit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless the marriage-deed will bear it?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could claim no right, to lands or rents,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for our parents' settlements;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had been but younger sons o' th' earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Debarr'd it all, but for our birth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What honours or estates of peers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cou'd be preserv'd but by their heirs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what security maintains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their right and title, but the banes?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What crowns could be hereditary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If greatest monarchs did not marry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with their consorts consummate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their weightiest interests of state?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all the amours of princes are</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But guarantees of peace or war,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or what but marriage has a charm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rage of empires to disarm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make blood and desolation cease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fire and sword unite in peace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all their fierce contest for forage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conclude in articles of marriage?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor does the genial bed provide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less for the int'rests of the bride;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who else had not the least pretence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' as much as due benevolence;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could no more title take upon her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To virtue, quality, and honour.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ladies-errant, unconfin'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And feme-coverts t' all mankind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All women would be of one piece,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtuous matron and the miss;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nymphs of chaste Diana's train,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-152" id="noteref-152" epub:type="noteref">152</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same with those in LEWKNER's Lane;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-153" id="noteref-153" epub:type="noteref">153</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for the difference marriage makes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twixt wives and ladies of the lakes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Besides the joys of place and birth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sex's paradise on earth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A privilege so sacred held,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That none will to their mothers yield;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather than not go before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abandon Heaven at the door.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if th' indulgent law allows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A greater freedom to the spouse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The reason is, because the wife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Runs greater hazards of her life;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-154" id="noteref-154" epub:type="noteref">154</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is trusted with the form and matter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all mankind by careful nature;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where man brings nothing but the stuff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She frames the wond'rous fabric of;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who therefore, in a streight, may freely</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Demand the clergy of her belly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make it save her the same way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seldom misses to betray;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless both parties wisely enter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the liturgy indenture,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though some fits of small contest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sometimes fall out among the best,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is no more than ev'ry lover</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Does from his hackney-lady suffer;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That makes no breach of faith and love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather (sometimes) serves t' improve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For as in running, ev'ry pace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is but between two legs a race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which both do their uttermost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To get before, and win the post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet when they're at their race's ends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They're still as kind and constant friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, to relieve their weariness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By turns give one another ease;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So all those false alarms of strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the husband and the wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And little quarrels, often prove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be but new recruits of love;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When those wh' are always kind or coy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In time must either tire or cloy.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor are their loudest clamours more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than as they're relish'd, sweet or sour;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like musick, that proves bad or good;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>According as 'tis understood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all amours, a lover burns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With frowns as well as smiles by turns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hearts have been as aft with sullen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As charming looks surpriz'd and stolen.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then why should more bewitching clamour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some lovers not as much enamour?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For discords make the sweetest airs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And curses are a kind of pray'rs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too slight alloys for all those grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Felicities by marriage gain'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For nothing else has pow'r to settle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' interests of love perpetual;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An act and deed, that that makes one heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes another's counter-part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And passes fines on faith and love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inroll'd and register'd above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To seal the slippery knots of vows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which nothing else but death can loose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what security's too strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guard that gentle heart from wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to its friend is glad to pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Itself away, and all it has;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like an anchorite, gives over</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This world for th' heaven of lover?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I grant (quoth she) there are some few</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who take that course, and find it true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But millions whom the same does sentence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To heav'n b' another way — repentance.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love's arrows are but shot at rovers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though all they hit, they turn to lovers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the weighty consequents</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Depend upon more blind events,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than gamesters, when they play a set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With greatest cunning at piquet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put out with caution, but take in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They know not what, unsight, unseen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what do lovers, when they're fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In one another's arms embrac't,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But strive to plunder, and convey</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each other, like a prize, away?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To change the property of selves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As sucking children are by elves?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if they use their persons so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What will they to their fortunes do?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their fortunes! the perpetual aims</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all their extasies and flames.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when the money's on the book,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, All my worldly goods — but spoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(The formal livery and seisin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That puts a lover in possession,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that alone the bridegroom's wedded;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bride a flam, that's superseded.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that their faith is still made good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the oaths to us they vow'd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when we once resign our pow'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W' have nothing left we can call ours:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our money's now become the Miss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your lives and services;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we forsaken, and postpon'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But bawds to what before we own'd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, as it made y' at first gallant us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So now hires others to supplant us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until 'tis all turn'd out of doors,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As we had been) for new amours;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what did ever heiress yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By being born to lordships get?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the more lady sh' is of manours,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She's but expos'd to more trepanners,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pays for their projects and designs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for her own destruction fines;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And does but tempt them with her riches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To use her as the Dev'l does witches;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who takes it for a special grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be their cully for a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That when the time's expir'd, the drazels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ever may become his vassals:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So she, bewitch'd by rooks and spirits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betrays herself, and all sh' inherits;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is bought and sold, like stolen goods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By pimps, and match-makers, and bawds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until they force her to convey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And steal the thief himself away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These are the everlasting fruits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your passionate love-suits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Th' effects of all your amorous fancies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To portions and inheritances;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your love-sick rapture for fruition</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dowry, jointure, and tuition;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which you make address and courtship;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ad with your bodies strive to worship,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That th' infants' fortunes may partake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of love too, for the mother's sake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For these you play at purposes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love your love's with A's and B's:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For these at Beste and L'Ombre woo,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And play for love and money too;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strive who shall be the ablest man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At right gallanting of a fan;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who the most genteelly bred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At sucking of a vizard-head;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How best t' accost us in all quarters;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' our question — and — command new Garters</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And solidly discourse upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All sorts of dresses, Pro and Con.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there's no mystery nor trade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in the art of love is made:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when you have more debts to pay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than Michaelmas and Lady-Day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no way possible to do't,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But love and oaths, and restless suit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To us y' apply to pay the scores</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your cully'd, past amours;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Act o'er your flames and darts again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And charge us with your wounds and pain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which others influences long since</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have charm'd your noses with and shins;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which the surgeon is unpaid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like to be, without our aid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lord! what an am'rous thing is want!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How debts and mortgages inchant!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What graces must that lady have</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That can from executions save!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What charms that can reverse extent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And null decree and exigent!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What magical attracts and graces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That can redeem from Scire facias!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From bonds and statutes can discharge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from contempts of courts enlarge!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These are the highest excellencies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all your true or false pretences:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you would damn yourselves, and swear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As much t' an hostess dowager,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown fat and pursy by retail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pots of beer and bottled ale;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And find her fitter for your turn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fat is wondrous apt to burn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who at your flames would soon take fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Relent, and melt to your desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like a candle in the socket,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolve her graces int' your pocket.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>By this time 'twas grown dark and late,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they heard a knocking at the gate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laid on in haste with such a powder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blows grew louder still and louder;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which HUDIBRAS, as if th' had been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bestow'd as freely on his skin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Expounding, by his inward light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or rather more prophetick fright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be the Wizard, come to search,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And take him napping in the lurch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn'd pale as ashes or a clout;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But why or wherefore is a doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For men will tremble, and turn paler,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With too much or too little valour.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His heart laid on, as if it try'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To force a passage through his side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impatient (as he vow'd) to wait 'em,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in a fury to fly at 'em;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore beat, and laid about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find a cranny to creep out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she, who saw in what a taking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight was by his furious quaking,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Undaunted cry'd, Courage, Sir Knight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Know, I'm resolv'd to break no rite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hospitality t' a stranger;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, to secure you out of danger,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will here myself stand sentinel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guard this pass 'gainst SIDROPHEL.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Women, you know, do seldom fail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the stoutest men turn tail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bravely scorn to turn their backs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the desp'ratest attacks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At this the Knight grew resolute</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As IRONSIDE and HARDIKNUTE<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>His fortitude began to rally,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out he cry'd aloud to sally.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she besought him to convey</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His courage rather out o' th' way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lodge in ambush on the floor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or fortify'd behind a door;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That if the enemy shou'd enter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He might relieve her in th' adventure.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Mean while they knock'd against the door</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As fierce as at the gate before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which made the Renegado Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Relapse again t' his former fright.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought it desperate to stay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till th' enemy had forc'd his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather post himself, to serve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lady, for a fresh reserve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His duty was not to dispute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what sh' had order'd execute;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which he resolv'd in haste t' obey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore stoutly march'd away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all h' encounter'd fell upon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though in the dark, and all alone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till fear, that braver feats performs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ever courage dar'd in arms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had drawn him up before a pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stand upon his guard, and face:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This he courageously invaded,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And having enter'd, barricado'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Insconc'd himself as formidable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As could be underneath a table,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where he lay down in ambush close,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' expect th' arrival of his foes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Few minutes he had lain perdue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guard his desp'rate avenue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before he heard a dreadful shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As loud as putting to the rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which impatiently alarm'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He fancy'd th' enemy had storm'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after ent'ring, SIDROPHEL</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fall'n upon the guards pell-mell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He therefore sent out all his senses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring him in intelligences,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which vulgars, out of ignorance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mistake for falling in a trance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But those that trade in geomancy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Affirm to be the strength of fancy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which the Lapland Magi deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And things incredible reveal.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mean while the foe beat up his quarters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And storm'd the out-works of his fortress:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as another, of the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Degree and party, in arms and fame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in the same cause had engag'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At war with equal conduct wag'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By vent'ring only but to thrust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His head a span beyond his post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B' a gen'ral of the cavaliers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was dragg'd thro' a window by th' ears;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So he was serv'd in his redoubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by the other end pull'd out.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Soon as they had him at their mercy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They put him to the cudgel fiercely,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if they'd scorn'd to trade or barter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By giving or by taking quarter:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They stoutly on his quarters laid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until his scouts came in t' his aid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when a man is past his sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There's no way to reduce him thence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But twinging him by th' ears or nose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or laying on of heavy blows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if that will not do the deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To burning with hot irons proceed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner was he come t' himself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But on his neck a sturdy elf</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clapp'd, in a trice, his cloven hoof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus attack'd him with reproof;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mortal, thou art betray'd to us</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B' our friend, thy Evil Genius,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, for thy horrid perjuries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy breach of faith, and turning lies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Brethren's privilege (against</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wicked) on themselves, the Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has here thy wretched carcase sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For just revenge and punishment;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which thou hast now no way to lessen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But by an open, free confession;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if we catch thee failing once,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twill fall the heavier on thy bones.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What made thee venture to betray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And filch the lady's heart away?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Spirit her to matrimony? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That which contracts all matches — money.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was th' inchantment oft her riches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made m' apply t' your croney witches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, in return, wou'd pay th' expence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wear and tear of conscience;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which I cou'd have patch'd up, and turn'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the hundredth part of what I earn'd.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Didst thou not love her then? Speak true.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No more (quoth he) than I love you. —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How would'st th' have us'd her, and her money? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First turn'd her up to alimony;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And laid her dowry out in law,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To null her jointure with a flaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which I before-hand had agreed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' have put, on purpose in the deed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bar her widow's making over</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' a friend in trust, or private lover.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What made thee pick and chuse her out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' employ their sorceries about? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That which makes gamesters play with those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have least wit, and most to lose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But didst thou scourge thy vessel thus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As thou hast damn'd thyself to us?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I see you take me for an ass:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis true, I thought the trick wou'd pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a woman well enough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As 't has been often found by proof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose humours are not to be won,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when they are impos'd upon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For love approves of all they do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stand for candidates, and woo.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Why didst thou forge those shameful lies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bears and witches in disguise?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That is no more than authors give</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rabble credit to believe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A trick of following their leaders,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To entertain their gentle readers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we have now no other way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of passing all we do or say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, when 'tis natural and true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will be believ'd b' a very few,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the danger of offence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fatal enemy of sense.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Why did thou chuse that cursed sin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hypocrisy, to set up in?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Because it is in the thriving'st calling,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only Saints-bell that rings all in;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which all churches are concern'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is the easiest to be learn'd:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no degrees, unless th' employ't,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can ever gain much, or enjoy't:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gift that is not only able</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To domineer among the rabble,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But by the laws impower'd to rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And awe the greatest that stand out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which few hold forth against, for fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their hands should slip, and come too near;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no sin else among the Saints</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is taught so tenderly against.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What made thee break thy plighted vows? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That which makes others break a house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hang, and scorn ye all, before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Endure the plague of being poor.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, I see you have more tricks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all your doating politicks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That are grown old, and out of fashion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compar'd with your New Reformation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we must come to school to you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To learn your more refin'd, and new.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, If you will give me leave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tell you what I now perceive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You'll find yourself an arrant chouse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If y' were but at a Meeting-House. —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis true, quoth he, we ne'er come there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because, w' have let 'em out by th' year.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Truly, quoth he, you can't imagine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What wond'rous things they will engage in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That as your fellow-fiends in Hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were angels all before they fell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So are you like to be agen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compar'd with th' angels of us men.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, I am resolv'd to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy scholar in this mystery;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore first desire to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some principles on which you go.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes a knave a child of God,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one of us? — A livelihood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What renders beating out of brains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And murder, godliness? — Great gains.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What's tender conscience? — 'Tis a botch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That will not bear the gentlest touch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But breaking out, dispatches more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than th' epidemical'st plague-sore.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes y' encroach upon our trade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And damn all others? — To be paid.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What's orthodox, and true, believing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against a conscience? — A good living.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes rebelling against Kings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Good Old Cause? — Administrings.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes all doctrines plain and clear? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About two hundred pounds a year.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And that which was prov'd true before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prove false again? — Two hundred more.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes the breaking of all oaths</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A holy duty? — Food and cloaths.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What laws and freedom, persecution? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>B'ing out of pow'r, and contribution.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes a church a den of thieves? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dean and chapter, and white sleeves.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Ad what would serve, if those were gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make it orthodox? — Our own.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What makes morality a crime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The most notorious of the time;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Morality, which both the Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wicked too, cry out against? —</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cause grace and virtue are within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prohibited degrees of kin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore no true Saint allows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They shall be suffer'd to espouse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Saints can need no conscience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with morality dispense;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As virtue's impious, when 'tis rooted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In nature only, and not imputed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But why the wicked should do so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We neither know, or care to do.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What's liberty of conscience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I' th' natural and genuine sense?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis to restore, with more security,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rebellion to its ancient purity;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And christian liberty reduce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To th' elder practice of the Jews.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For a large conscience is all one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And signifies the same with none.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It is enough (quoth he) for once,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And has repriev'd thy forfeit bones:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>NICK MACHIAVEL had ne'er a trick,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Though he gave his name to our Old Nick,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But was below the least of these,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pass i' th' world for holiness.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This said, the furies and the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In th' instant vanish'd out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left him in the dark alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With stinks of brimstone and his own.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Queen of Night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-158" id="noteref-158" epub:type="noteref">158</a> whose large command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rules all the sea, and half the land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over moist and crazy brains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In high spring-tides, at midnight reigns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was now declining to the west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To go to bed, and take her rest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When HUDIBRAS, whose stubborn blows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deny'd his bones that soft repose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay still expecting worse and more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stretch'd out at length upon the floor;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though he shut his eyes as fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if h' had been to sleep his last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw all the shapes that fear or wizards</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do make the Devil wear for vizards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pricking up his ears, to hark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he cou'd hear too in the dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was first invaded with a groan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after in a feeble tone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These trembling words: Unhappy wretch!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What hast thou gotten by this fetch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all thy tricks, in this new trade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy holy brotherhood o' th' blade?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By sauntring still on some adventure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And growing to thy horse a Centaure?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-159" id="noteref-159" epub:type="noteref">159</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stuff thy skin with swelling knobs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cruel and hard-wooded drubs?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still th' hast had the worst on't yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well in conquest as defeat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Night is the sabbath of mankind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rest the body and the mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which now thou art deny'd to keep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cure thy labour'd corpse with sleep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Knight, who heard the words, explain'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As meant to him, this reprimand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the character did hit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Point-blank upon his case so fit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Believ'd it was some drolling spright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That staid upon the guard that night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one of those h' had seen, and felt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drubs he had so freely dealt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, after a short pause and groan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The doleful Spirit thus went on:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This 'tis t' engage with dogs and bears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pell-mell together by the ears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after painful bangs and knocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lie in limbo in the stocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the pinnacle of glory</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fall headlong into purgatory.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Thought he, this devil's full of malice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in my late disasters rallies:)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condemn'd to whipping, but declin'd it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By being more heroic-minded:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at a riding handled worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With treats more slovenly and coarse:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Engag'd with fiends in stubborn wars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hot disputes with conjurers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when th' hadst bravely won the day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wast fain to steal thyself away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(I see, thought he, this shameless elf</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wou'd fain steal me too from myself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That impudently dares to own</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What I have suffer'd for and done,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now but vent'ring to betray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hast met with vengeance the same way.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thought he, how does the Devil know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What 'twas that I design'd to do?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His office of intelligence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His oracles, are ceas'd long since;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he knows nothing of the Saints,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what some treacherous spy acquaints.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is some pettifogging fiend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some under door-keeper's friend's friend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That undertakes to understand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And juggles at the second-hand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now would pass for Spirit Po,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all mens' dark concerns foreknow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I think I need not fear him for't;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These rallying devils do no hurt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With that he rouz'd his drooping heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hastily cry'd out, What art?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wretch (quoth he) whom want of grace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has brought to this unhappy place.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I do believe thee, quoth the Knight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus far I'm sure th' art in the right;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And know what 'tis that troubles thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Better than thou hast guess'd of me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou art some paultry, black-guard spright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Condemn'd to drudg'ry in the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou hast no work to do in th' house</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor half-penny to drop in shoes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the raising of which sum,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You dare not be so troublesome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pinch the slatterns black and blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For leaving you their work to do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is your bus'ness good Pug-Robin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And your diversion dull dry-bobbing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' entice fanaticks in the dirt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wash them clean in ditches for't;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which conceit you are so proud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At ev'ry jest you laugh aloud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As now you wou'd have done by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that I barr'd your raillery.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sir (quoth the voice) y'are no such Sophi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-160" id="noteref-160" epub:type="noteref">160</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As you would have the world judge of ye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If you design to weigh our talents</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I' the standard of your own false balance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or think it possible to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Us ghosts as well as we do you;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We, who have been the everlasting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Companions of your drubs and basting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never left you in contest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With male or female, man or beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But prov'd as true t' ye, and entire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all adventures, as your Squire.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Quoth he, That may be said as true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By the idlest pug of all your crew:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For none cou'd have betray'd us worse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than those allies of ours and yours.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I have sent him for a token</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To your Low-Country HOGEN-MOGEN,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To whose infernal shores I hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He'll swing like skippers in a rope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, if y' have been more just to me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(As I am apt to think) than he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I am afraid it is as true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What th' ill-affected say of you:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Y' have spous'd the Covenant and Cause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By holding up your cloven paws.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sir, quoth the voice, 'tis true, I grant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We made and took the Covenant;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that no more concerns the Cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than other perj'ries do the laws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which when they're prov'd in open court,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wear wooden peccadillo's for't:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-161" id="noteref-161" epub:type="noteref">161</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that's the reason Cov'nanters</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hold up their hands like rogues at bars.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I see, quoth HUDIBRAS, from whence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These scandals of the Saints commence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That are but natural effects</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Satan's malice, and his sects,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those Spider-Saints, that hang by threads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spun out o' th' intrails of their heads.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sir, quoth the voice, that may as true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And properly be said of you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose talents may compare with either,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or both the other put together.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all the Independents do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is only what you forc'd 'em to;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You, who are not content alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tricks to put the Devil down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But must have armies rais'd to back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gospel-work you undertake;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if artillery, and edge-tools,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were the only engines to save souls;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While he, poor devil, has no pow'r</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By force to run down and devour;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has ne'er a Classis; cannot sentence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stools or poundage of repentance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is ty'd up only to design,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' entice, and tempt, and undermine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which you all his arts out-do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prove yourselves his betters too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hence 'tis possessions do less evil<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-162" id="noteref-162" epub:type="noteref">162</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than mere temptations of the Devil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which, all the horrid'st actions done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are charg'd in courts of law upon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because unless they help the elf,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He can do little of himself;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And therefore where he's best possess'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Acts most against his interest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surprizes none, but those wh' have priests</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To turn him out, and exorcists,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Supply'd with spiritual provision,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And magazines of ammunition</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With crosses, relicks, crucifixes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beads, pictures, rosaries, and pixes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tools of working our salvation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mere mechanick operation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With holy water, like a sluice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To overflow all avenues.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But those wh' are utterly unarm'd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' oppose his entrance, if he storm'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He never offers to surprize,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although his falsest enemies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But is content to be their drudge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on their errands glad to trudge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For where are all your forfeitures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Entrusted in safe hands but ours?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who are but jailors of the holes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dungeons where you clap up souls;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like under-keepers, turn the keys,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>T' your mittimus anathemas;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never boggle to restore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The members you deliver o're</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon demand, with fairer justice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than all your covenanting Trustees;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless to punish them the worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You put them in the secular pow'rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pass their souls, as some demise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same estate in mortgage twice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When to a legal Utlegation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-163" id="noteref-163" epub:type="noteref">163</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>You turn your excommunication,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for a groat unpaid, that's due,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Distrain on soul and body too.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-164" id="noteref-164" epub:type="noteref">164</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thought he, 'tis no mean part of civil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>State prudence to cajole the Devil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not to handle him too rough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When h' has us in his cloven hoof.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>T' is true, quoth he, that intercourse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has pass'd between your friends and ours;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That as you trust us, in our way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To raise your members, and to lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We send you others of our own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Denounc'd to hang themselves or drown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or, frighted with our oratory,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To leap down headlong many a story</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have us'd all means to propagate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your mighty interests of state;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laid out our spiritual gifts to further</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your great designs of rage and murther.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if the Saints are nam'd from blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We only have made that title good;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if it were but in our power,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We should not scruple to do more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not be half a soul behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all dissenters of mankind.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Right, quoth the voice, and as I scorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be ungrateful, in return</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all those kind good offices,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'll free you out of this distress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set you down in safety, where</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is no time to tell you here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cock crows, and the morn grows on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When 'tis decreed I must be gone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if I leave you here till day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You'll find it hard to get away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With that the Spirit grop'd about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find th' inchanted hero out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And try'd with haste to lift him up;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But found his forlorn hope, his crup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unserviceable with kicks and blows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receiv'd from harden'd-hearted foes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought to drag him by the heels,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Gresham carts, with legs for wheels;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But fear, that soonest cures those sores</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In danger of relapse to worse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came in t' assist him with it's aid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up his sinking vessel weigh'd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sooner was he fit to trudge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But both made ready to dislodge.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Spirit hors'd him like a sack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the vehicle his back;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bore him headlong into th' hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With some few rubs against the wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where finding out the postern lock'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And th' avenues as strongly block'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>H' attack'd the window, storm'd the glass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a moment gain'd the pass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thro' which he dragg'd the worsted souldier's</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fore-quarters out by the head and shoulders;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cautiously began to scout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find their fellow-cattle out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was it half a minute's quest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>E're he retriev'd the champion's beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ty'd to a pale, instead of rack;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ne'er a saddle on his back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor pistols at the saddle-bow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Convey'd away the Lord knows how,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought it was no time to stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And let the night too steal away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in a trice advanc'd the Knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the bare ridge, bolt upright:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And groping out for RALPHO's jade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He found the saddle too was stray'd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the place a lump of soap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On which he speedily leap'd up;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turning to the gate the rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He kick'd and cudgell'd on amain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While HUDIBRAS, with equal haste,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On both sides laid about as fast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spurr'd as jockies use to break,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or padders to secure, a neck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where let us leave 'em for a time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to their Churches turn our rhyme;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hold forth their declining state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which now come near an even rate.</span>
